                         BBR Congestion Control
                       draft-ietf-ccwg-bbr-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies the BBR congestion control algorithm.  BBR
   ("Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time") uses recent
   measurements of a transport connection's delivery rate, round-trip
   time, and packet loss rate to build an explicit model of the network
   path.  BBR then uses this model to control both how fast it sends
   data and the maximum volume of data it allows in flight in the
   network at any time.  Relative to loss-based congestion control
   algorithms such as Reno [RFC5681] or CUBIC [RFC9438], BBR offers
   substantially higher throughput for bottlenecks with shallow buffers
   or random losses, and substantially lower queueing delays for
   bottlenecks with deep buffers (avoiding "bufferbloat").  BBR can be
   implemented in any transport protocol that supports packet-delivery
   acknowledgment.  Thus far, open source implementations are available
   for TCP [RFC9293] and QUIC [RFC9000].  This document specifies
   version 3 of the BBR algorithm, BBRv3.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet has traditionally used loss-based congestion control
   algorithms like Reno ([Jac88], [Jac90], [WS95] [RFC5681]) and CUBIC
   ([HRX08], [RFC9438]).  These algorithms worked well for many years
   because they were sufficiently well-matched to the prevalent range of
   bandwidth-delay products and degrees of buffering in Internet paths.
   As the Internet has evolved, loss-based congestion control is
   increasingly problematic in several important scenarios:

   1.  Shallow buffers: In shallow buffers, packet loss can happen even
       when a link has low utilization.  With high-speed, long-haul
       links employing commodity switches with shallow buffers, loss-
       based congestion control can cause abysmal throughput because it
       overreacts, making large multiplicative decreases in sending rate
       upon packet loss (by 50% in Reno [RFC5681] or 30% in CUBIC
       [RFC9438]), and only slowly growing its sending rate thereafter.
       This can happen even if the packet loss arises from transient
       traffic bursts when the link is mostly idle.

   2.  Deep buffers: At the edge of today's Internet, loss-based
       congestion control can cause the problem of "bufferbloat", by
       repeatedly filling deep buffers in last-mile links and causing
       high queuing delays.

   3.  Dynamic traffic workloads: With buffers of any depth, dynamic
       mixes of newly-entering flows or flights of data from recently
       idle flows can cause frequent packet loss.  In such scenarios
       loss-based congestion control can fail to maintain its fair share
       of bandwidth, leading to poor application performance.

   In both the shallow-buffer (1.) or dynamic-traffic (3.) scenarios
   mentioned above it is difficult to achieve full throughput with loss-
   based congestion control in practice: for CUBIC, sustaining 10Gbps
   over 100ms RTT needs a packet loss rate below 0.000003% (i.e., more
   than 40 seconds between packet losses), and over a 100ms RTT path a
   more feasible loss rate like 1% can only sustain at most 3 Mbps
   [RFC9438].  These limitations apply no matter what the bottleneck
   link is capable of or what the connection's fair share is.
   Furthermore, failure to reach the fair share can cause poor
   throughput and poor tail latency for latency-sensitive applications.

   The BBR ("Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time")
   congestion control algorithm is a model-based algorithm that takes an
   approach different from loss-based congestion control: BBR uses
   recent measurements of a transport connection's delivery rate, round-
   trip time, and packet loss rate to build an explicit model of the
   network path, including its estimated available bandwidth, bandwidth-
   delay product, and the maximum volume of data that the connection can
   place in flight in the network without causing excessive queue
   pressure.  It then uses this model in order to guide its control
   behavior in seeking high throughput and low queue pressure.

   This document describes the current version of the BBR algorithm,
   BBRv3.  The original version of the algorithm, BBRv1, was described
   previously at a high level [CCGHJ16][CCGHJ17].  The implications of
   BBR in allowing high utilization of high-speed networks with shallow
   buffers have been discussed in other work [MM19].  Active work on the
   BBR algorithm is continuing.

   This document is organized as follows.  Section 2 provides various
   definitions that will be used throughout this document.  Section 3
   provides an overview of the design of the BBR algorithm, and section
   4 describes the BBR algorithm in detail, including BBR's network path
   model, control parameters, and state machine.  Section 5 describes
   the implementation status, section 6 describes security
   considerations, section 7 notes that there are no IANA
   considerations, and section 8 closes with Acknowledgments.

2.  Terminology

   This document defines state variables and constants for the BBR
   algorithm.

   Variables for connection state (C), per-packet state (P), or per-ACK
   rate sample (rs) that are not defined below are defined in
   Section 4.6, "Delivery Rate Samples".

   In this document, "acknowledged" or "delivered" data means any
   transmitted data that the remote transport endpoint has confirmed
   that it has received, e.g., via a QUIC ACK Range [RFC9000], TCP
   cumulative acknowledgment [RFC9293], or TCP SACK ("Selective
   Acknowledgment") block [RFC2018].

2.1.  Transport Connection State

   C.delivered: The total amount of data (tracked in octets or in
   packets) delivered so far over the lifetime of the transport
   connection C.

   SMSS: The Sender Maximum Segment Size.

   is_cwnd_limited: True if the connection has fully utilized its cwnd
   at any point in the last packet-timed round trip.

   InitialCwnd: The initial congestion window set by the transport
   protocol implementation for the connection at initialization time.

2.2.  Per-Packet State

   packet.delivered: C.delivered when the given packet was sent by
   transport connection C.

   packet.departure_time: The earliest pacing departure time for the
   given packet.

   packet.tx_in_flight: The volume of data that was estimated to be in
   flight at the time of the transmission of the packet.

2.3.  Per-ACK Rate Sample State

   rs.delivered: The volume of data delivered between the transmission
   of the packet that has just been ACKed and the current time.

   rs.delivery_rate: The delivery rate (aka bandwidth) sample obtained
   from the packet that has just been ACKed.

   rs.rtt: The RTT sample calculated based on the most recently-sent
   segment of the segments that have just been ACKed.

   rs.newly_acked: The volume of data cumulatively or selectively
   acknowledged upon the ACK that was just received.  (This quantity is
   referred to as "DeliveredData" in [RFC6937].)

   rs.newly_lost: The volume of data newly marked lost upon the ACK that
   was just received.

   rs.tx_in_flight: The volume of data that was estimated to be in
   flight at the time of the transmission of the packet that has just
   been ACKed (the most recently sent segment among segments ACKed by
   the ACK that was just received).

   rs.lost: The volume of data that was declared lost between the
   transmission and acknowledgement of the packet that has just been
   ACKed (the most recently sent segment among segments ACKed by the ACK
   that was just received).

2.4.  Output Control Parameters

   cwnd: The transport sender's congestion window, which limits the
   amount of data in flight.

   BBR.pacing_rate: The current pacing rate for a BBR flow, which
   controls inter-packet spacing.

   BBR.send_quantum: The maximum size of a data aggregate scheduled and
   transmitted together.

2.5.  Pacing State and Parameters

   BBR.pacing_gain: The dynamic gain factor used to scale BBR.bw to
   produce BBR.pacing_rate.

   BBRPacingMarginPercent: The static discount factor of 1% used to
   scale BBR.bw to produce BBR.pacing_rate.

   BBR.next_departure_time: The earliest pacing departure time for the
   next packet BBR schedules for transmission.

   BBRStartupPacingGain: A constant specifying the minimum gain value
   for calculating the pacing rate that will allow the sending rate to
   double each round (4 * ln(2) ~= 2.77) [BBRStartupPacingGain]; used in
   Startup mode for BBR.pacing_gain.

   BBRDrainPacingGain: A constant specifying the pacing gain value used
   in Drain mode, to attempt to drain the estimated queue at the
   bottleneck link in one round-trip or less.  As noted in
   [BBRDrainPacingGain], any value at or below 1 / BBRStartupCwndGain =
   1 / 2 = 0.5 will theoretically achieve this.  BBR uses the value
   0.35, which has been shown to offer good performance when compared
   with other alternatives.

2.6.  cwnd State and Parameters

   BBR.cwnd_gain: The dynamic gain factor used to scale the estimated
   BDP to produce a congestion window (cwnd).

   BBRDefaultCwndGain: A constant specifying the minimum gain value that
   allows the sending rate to double each round (2)
   [BBRStartupCwndGain].  Used by default in most phases for
   BBR.cwnd_gain.

2.7.  General Algorithm State

   BBR.state: The current state of a BBR flow in the BBR state machine.

   BBR.round_count: Count of packet-timed round trips elapsed so far.

   BBR.round_start: A boolean that BBR sets to true once per packet-
   timed round trip, on ACKs that advance BBR.round_count.

   when probing for bandwidth (the default is 2%).

   BBRBeta: The default multiplicative decrease to make upon each round
   trip during which the connection detects packet loss (the value is
   0.7).

   BBRHeadroom: The multiplicative factor to apply to
   BBR.inflight_longterm when calculating a volume of free headroom to
   try to leave unused in the path (e.g. free space in the bottleneck
   buffer or free time slots in the bottleneck link) that can be used by
   cross traffic (the value is 0.15).

   BBRMinPipeCwnd: The minimal cwnd value BBR targets, to allow
   pipelining with endpoints that follow an "ACK every other packet"
   delayed-ACK policy: 4 * SMSS.

2.9.  Network Path Model Parameters

2.9.1.  Data Rate Network Path Model Parameters

   The data rate model parameters together estimate both the sending
   rate required to reach the full bandwidth available to the flow
   (BBR.max_bw), and the maximum pacing rate control parameter that is
   consistent with the queue pressure objective (BBR.bw).

   BBR.max_bw: The windowed maximum recent bandwidth sample, obtained
   using the BBR delivery rate sampling algorithm in Section 4.6,
   measured during the current or previous bandwidth probing cycle (or
   during Startup, if the flow is still in that state).  (Part of the
   long-term model.)

   BBR.bw_shortterm: The short-term maximum sending bandwidth that the
   algorithm estimates is safe for matching the current network path
   delivery rate, based on any loss signals in the current bandwidth
   probing cycle.  This is generally lower than max_bw.  (Part of the
   short-term model.)

   BBR.bw: The maximum sending bandwidth that the algorithm estimates is
   appropriate for matching the current network path delivery rate,
   given all available signals in the model, at any time scale.  It is
   the min() of max_bw and bw_shortterm.

2.9.2.  Data Volume Network Path Model Parameters

   The data volume model parameters together estimate both the volume of
   in-flight data required to reach the full bandwidth available to the
   flow (BBR.max_inflight), and the maximum volume of data that is
   consistent with the queue pressure objective (cwnd).

   BBR.min_rtt: The windowed minimum round-trip time sample measured
   over the last MinRTTFilterLen = 10 seconds.  This attempts to
   estimate the two-way propagation delay of the network path when all
   connections sharing a bottleneck are using BBR, but also allows BBR
   to estimate the value required for a BBR.bdp estimate that allows
   full throughput if there are legacy loss-based Reno or CUBIC flows
   sharing the bottleneck.

   BBR.bdp: The estimate of the network path's BDP (Bandwidth-Delay
   Product), computed as: BBR.bdp = BBR.bw * BBR.min_rtt.

   BBR.extra_acked: A volume of data that is the estimate of the recent
   degree of aggregation in the network path.

   BBR.offload_budget: The estimate of the minimum volume of data
   necessary to achieve full throughput when using sender (TSO/GSO) and
   receiver (LRO, GRO) host offload mechanisms.

   BBR.max_inflight: The estimate of the volume of in-flight data
   required to fully utilize the bottleneck bandwidth available to the
   flow, based on the BDP estimate (BBR.bdp), the aggregation estimate
   (BBR.extra_acked), the offload budget (BBR.offload_budget), and
   BBRMinPipeCwnd.

   BBR.inflight_longterm: The long-term maximum volume of in-flight data
   that the algorithm estimates will produce acceptable queue pressure,
   based on signals in the current or previous bandwidth probing cycle,
   as measured by loss.  That is, if a flow is probing for bandwidth,
   and observes that sending a particular volume of in-flight data
   causes a loss rate higher than the loss rate objective, it sets
   inflight_longterm to that volume of data.  (Part of the long-term
   model.)

   BBR.inflight_shortterm: Analogous to BBR.bw_shortterm, the short-term
   maximum volume of in-flight data that the algorithm estimates is safe
   for matching the current network path delivery process, based on any
   loss signals in the current bandwidth probing cycle.  This is
   generally lower than max_inflight or inflight_longterm.  (Part of the
   short-term model.)

2.10.  State for Responding to Congestion

   BBR.bw_latest: a 1-round-trip max of delivered bandwidth
   (rs.delivery_rate).

   BBR.inflight_latest: a 1-round-trip max of delivered volume of data
   (rs.delivered).

2.11.  Estimating BBR.max_bw

   BBR.MaxBwFilter: The filter for tracking the maximum recent
   rs.delivery_rate sample, for estimating BBR.max_bw.

   MaxBwFilterLen: The filter window length for BBR.MaxBwFilter = 2
   (representing up to 2 ProbeBW cycles, the current cycle and the
   previous full cycle).

   BBR.cycle_count: The virtual time used by the BBR.max_bw filter
   window.  Note that BBR.cycle_count only needs to be tracked with a
   single bit, since the BBR.MaxBwFilter only needs to track samples
   from two time slots: the previous ProbeBW cycle and the current
   ProbeBW cycle.

2.12.  Estimating BBR.extra_acked

   BBR.extra_acked_interval_start: the start of the time interval for
   estimating the excess amount of data acknowledged due to aggregation
   effects.

   BBR.extra_acked_delivered: the volume of data marked as delivered
   since BBR.extra_acked_interval_start.

   BBR.ExtraACKedFilter: the max filter tracking the recent maximum
   degree of aggregation in the path.

   BBRExtraAckedFilterLen = The window length of the
   BBR.ExtraACKedFilter max filter window in steady-state: 10 (in units
   of packet-timed round trips).

2.13.  Startup Parameters and State

   BBR.full_bw_reached: A boolean that records whether BBR estimates
   that it has ever fully utilized its available bandwidth over the
   lifetime of the connection.

   BBR.full_bw_now: A boolean that records whether BBR estimates that it
   has fully utilized its available bandwidth since it most recetly
   started looking.

   BBR.full_bw: A recent baseline BBR.max_bw to estimate if BBR has
   "filled the pipe" in Startup.

   BBR.full_bw_count: The number of non-app-limited round trips without
   large increases in BBR.full_bw.

2.14.  ProbeRTT and min_rtt Parameters and State

2.14.1.  Parameters for Estimating BBR.min_rtt

   BBR.min_rtt_stamp: The wall clock time at which the current
   BBR.min_rtt sample was obtained.

   MinRTTFilterLen: A constant specifying the length of the BBR.min_rtt
   min filter window, MinRTTFilterLen is 10 secs.

2.14.2.  Parameters for Scheduling ProbeRTT

   BBRProbeRTTCwndGain = A constant specifying the gain value for
   calculating the cwnd during ProbeRTT: 0.5 (meaning that ProbeRTT
   attempts to reduce in-flight data to 50% of the estimated BDP).

   ProbeRTTDuration: A constant specifying the minimum duration for
   which ProbeRTT state holds inflight to BBRMinPipeCwnd or fewer
   packets: 200 ms.

   ProbeRTTInterval: A constant specifying the minimum time interval
   between ProbeRTT states: 5 secs.

   BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay: The minimum RTT sample recorded in the last
   ProbeRTTInterval.

   BBR.probe_rtt_min_stamp: The wall clock time at which the current
   BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay sample was obtained.

   BBR.probe_rtt_expired: A boolean recording whether the
   BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay has expired and is due for a refresh with an
   application idle period or a transition into ProbeRTT state.

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Design Overview

3.1.  High-Level Design Goals

   The high-level goal of BBR is to achieve both:

   1.  The full throughput (or approximate fair share thereof) available
       to a flow

       *  Achieved in a fast and scalable manner (using bandwidth in
          O(log(BDP)) time).

       *  Achieved with average packet loss rates of up to 1%.

   2.  Low queue pressure (low queuing delay and low packet loss).

   These goals are in tension: sending faster improves the odds of
   achieving (1) but reduces the odds of achieving (2), while sending
   slower improves the odds of achieving (2) but reduces the odds of
   achieving (1).  Thus the algorithm cannot maximize throughput or
   minimize queue pressure independently, and must jointly optimize
   both.

   To try to achieve these goals, and seek an operating point with high
   throughput and low delay [K79] [GK81], BBR aims to adapt its sending
   process to match the network delivery process, in two dimensions:

   1.  data rate: the rate at which the flow sends data should ideally
       match the rate at which the network delivers the flow's data (the
       available bottleneck bandwidth)

   2.  data volume: the amount of unacknowledged data in flight in the
       network should ideally match the bandwidth-delay product (BDP) of
       the path

   Both the control of the data rate (via the pacing rate) and data
   volume (directly via the congestion window or cwnd; and indirectly
   via the pacing rate) are important.  A mismatch in either dimension
   can cause the sender to fail to meet its high-level design goals:

   1.  volume mismatch: If a sender perfectly matches its sending rate
       to the available bandwidth, but its volume of in-flight data
       exceeds the BDP, then the sender can maintain a large standing
       queue, increasing network latency and risking packet loss.

   2.  rate mismatch: If a sender's volume of in-flight data matches the
       BDP perfectly but its sending rate exceeds the available
       bottleneck bandwidth (e.g. the sender transmits a BDP of data in
       an unpaced fashion, at the sender's link rate), then up to a full
       BDP of data can burst into the bottleneck queue, causing high
       delay and/or high loss.

3.2.  Algorithm Overview

   Based on the rationale above, BBR tries to spend most of its time
   matching its sending process (data rate and data volume) to the
   network path's delivery process.  To do this, it explores the
   2-dimensional control parameter space of (1) data rate ("bandwidth"
   or "throughput") and (2) data volume ("in-flight data"), with a goal
   of finding the maximum values of each control parameter that are
   consistent with its objective for queue pressure.

   Depending on what signals a given network path manifests at a given
   time, the objective for queue pressure is measured in terms of the
   most strict among:

   *  the amount of data that is estimated to be queued in the
      bottleneck buffer (data_in_flight - estimated_BDP): the objective
      is to maintain this amount at or below 1.5 * estimated_BDP

   *  the packet loss rate: the objective is a maximum per-round-trip
      packet loss rate of BBRLossThresh=2% (and an average packet loss
      rate considerably lower)

3.3.  State Machine Overview

   BBR varies its control parameters with a state machine that aims for
   high throughput, low latency, low loss, and an approximately fair
   sharing of bandwidth, while maintaining an up-to-date model of the
   network path.

   A BBR flow starts in the Startup state, and ramps up its sending rate
   quickly, to rapidly estimate the maximum available bandwidth
   (BBR.max_bw).  When it estimates the bottleneck bandwidth has been
   fully utilized, it enters the Drain state to drain the estimated
   queue.  In steady state a BBR flow mostly uses the ProbeBW states, to
   periodically briefly send faster to probe for higher capacity and
   then briefly send slower to try to drain any resulting queue.  If
   needed, it briefly enters the ProbeRTT state, to lower the sending
   rate to probe for lower BBR.min_rtt samples.  The detailed behavior
   for each state is described below.

3.4.  Network Path Model Overview

3.4.1.  High-Level Design Goals for the Network Path Model

   At a high level, the BBR model is trying to reflect two aspects of
   the network path:

   *  Model what's required for achieving full throughput: Estimate the
      data rate (BBR.max_bw) and data volume (BBR.max_inflight) required
      to fully utilize the fair share of the bottleneck bandwidth
      available to the flow.  This incorporates estimates of the maximum
      available bandwidth, the BDP of the path, and the requirements of
      any offload features on the end hosts or mechanisms on the network
      path that produce aggregation effects.

   *  Model what's permitted for achieving low queue pressure: Estimate
      the maximum data rate (BBR.bw) and data volume (cwnd) consistent
      with the queue pressure objective, as measured by the estimated
      degree of queuing and packet loss.

   Note that those two aspects are in tension: the highest throughput is
   available to the flow when it sends as fast as possible and occupies
   as many bottleneck buffer slots as possible; the lowest queue
   pressure is achieved by the flow when it sends as slow as possible
   and occupies as few bottleneck buffer slots as possible.  To resolve
   the tension, the algorithm aims to achieve the maximum throughput
   achievable while still meeting the queue pressure objective.

3.4.2.  Time Scales for the Network Model

   At a high level, the BBR model is trying to reflect the properties of
   the network path on two different time scales:

3.4.2.1.  Long-term model

   One goal is for BBR to maintain high average utilization of the fair
   share of the available bandwidth, over long time intervals.  This
   requires estimates of the path's data rate and volume capacities that
   are robust over long time intervals.  This means being robust to
   congestion signals that may be noisy or may reflect short-term
   congestion that has already abated by the time an ACK arrives.  This
   also means providing a robust history of the best recently-achievable
   performance on the path so that the flow can quickly and robustly aim
   to re-probe that level of performance whenever it decides to probe
   the capacity of the path.

3.4.2.2.  Short-term model

   A second goal of BBR is to react to every congestion signal,
   including loss, as if it may indicate a persistent/long-term increase
   in congestion and/or decrease in the bandwidth available to the flow,
   because that may indeed be the case.

3.4.2.3.  Time Scale Strategy

   BBR sequentially alternates between spending most of its time using
   short-term models to conservatively respect all congestion signals in
   case they represent persistent congestion, but periodically using its
   long-term model to robustly probe the limits of the available path
   capacity in case the congestion has abated and more capacity is
   available.

3.5.  Control Parameter Overview

   BBR uses its model to control the connection's sending behavior.
   Rather than using a single control parameter, like the cwnd parameter
   that limits the volume of in-flight data in the Reno and CUBIC
   congestion control algorithms, BBR uses three distinct control
   parameters:

   1.  pacing rate: the maximum rate at which BBR sends data.

   2.  send quantum: the maximum size of any aggregate that the
       transport sender implementation may need to transmit as a unit to
       amortize per-packet transmission overheads.

   3.  cwnd: the maximum volume of data BBR allows in flight in the
       network at any time.

3.6.  Environment and Usage

   BBR is a congestion control algorithm that is agnostic to transport-
   layer and link-layer technologies, requires only sender-side changes,
   and does not require changes in the network.  Open source
   implementations of BBR are available for the TCP [RFC9293] and QUIC
   [RFC9000] transport protocols, and these implementations have been
   used in production for a large volume of Internet traffic.  An open
   source implementation of BBR is also available for DCCP [RFC4340]
   [draft-romo-iccrg-ccid5].

3.7.  ECN

   This experimental version of BBR does not specify a specific response
   to Classic [RFC3168], Alternative Backoff with ECN (ABE) [RFC8511] or
   L4S [RFC9330] style ECN.  However, if the connection claims ECN
   support by marking packets using either the ECT(0) or ECT(1) code
   point, the congestion controller response MUST treat any CE marks as
   congestion.

   [RFC8311], Section 4.1 relaxes the requirement from RFC3168 that the
   congestion response to CE marks be identical to packet loss.  The
   congestion response requirements of L4S are detailed in [RFC9330],
   Section 4.3.

4.  Detailed Algorithm

4.1.  State Machine

   BBR implements a state machine that uses the network path model to
   guide its decisions, and the control parameters to enact its
   decisions.

4.1.1.  State Transition Diagram

   The following state transition diagram summarizes the flow of control
   and the relationship between the different states:

       +---- ProbeRTT <-----------+

4.1.2.  State Machine Operation Overview

   When starting up, BBR probes to try to quickly build a model of the
   network path; to adapt to later changes to the path or its traffic,
   BBR must continue to probe to update its model.  If the available
   bottleneck bandwidth increases, BBR must send faster to discover
   this.  Likewise, if the round-trip propagation delay changes, this
   changes the BDP, and thus BBR must send slower to get inflight below
   the new BDP in order to measure the new BBR.min_rtt.  Thus, BBR's
   state machine runs periodic, sequential experiments, sending faster
   to check for BBR.bw increases or sending slower to yield bandwidth,
   drain the queue, and check for BBR.min_rtt decreases.  The frequency,
   magnitude, duration, and structure of these experiments differ
   depending on what's already known (startup or steady-state) and
   application sending behavior (intermittent or continuous).

   This state machine has several goals:

   *  Achieve high throughput by efficiently utilizing available
      bandwidth.

   *  Achieve low latency and packet loss rates by keeping queues
      bounded and small.

   *  Share bandwidth with other flows in an approximately fair manner.

   *  Feed samples to the model estimators to refresh and update the
      model.

4.1.3.  State Machine Tactics

   In the BBR framework, at any given time the sender can choose one of
   the following tactics:

   *  Acceleration: Send faster then the network is delivering data: to
      probe the maximum bandwidth available to the flow

   *  Deceleration: Send slower than the network is delivering data: to
      reduce the amount of data in flight, with a number of overlapping
      motivations:

      -  Reducing queuing delay: to reduce queuing delay, to reduce
         latency for request/response cross-traffic (e.g. RPC, web
         traffic).

      -  Reducing packet loss: to reduce packet loss, to reduce tail
         latency for request/response cross-traffic (e.g. RPC, web
         traffic) and improve coexistence with Reno/CUBIC.

      -  Probing BBR.min_rtt: to probe the path's BBR.min_rtt

      -  Bandwidth convergence: to aid bandwidth fairness convergence,
         by leaving unused capacity in the bottleneck link or bottleneck
         buffer, to allow other flows that may have lower sending rates
         to discover and utilize the unused capacity

      -  Burst tolerance: to allow bursty arrivals of cross-traffic
         (e.g. short web or RPC requests) to be able to share the
         bottleneck link without causing excessive queuing delay or
         packet loss

   *  Cruising: Send at the same rate the network is delivering data:
      try to match the sending rate to the flow's current available
      bandwidth, to try to achieve high utilization of the available
      bandwidth without increasing queue pressure

   Throughout the lifetime of a BBR flow, it sequentially cycles through
   all three tactics, to measure the network path and try to optimize
   its operating point.

   BBR's state machine uses two control mechanisms: the pacing_gain and
   the cwnd.  Primarily, it uses the pacing_gain (see the "Pacing Rate"
   section), which controls how fast packets are sent relative to
   BBR.bw.  A pacing_gain > 1 decreases inter-packet time and increases
   inflight.  A pacing_gain < 1 has the opposite effect, increasing
   inter-packet time and while aiming to decrease inflight.  The cwnd is
   sufficiently larger than the BDP to allow the higher pacing gain to
   accumulate more packets in flight.  Only if the state machine needs
   to quickly reduce inflight to a particular absolute value, it uses
   the cwnd.

4.2.  Algorithm Organization

   The BBR algorithm is an event-driven algorithm that executes steps
   upon the following events: connection initialization, upon each ACK,
   upon the transmission of each quantum, and upon loss detection
   events.  All of the sub-steps invoked referenced below are described
   below.

4.2.1.  Initialization

   Upon transport connection initialization, BBR executes its
   initialization steps:

     BBROnInit():
       InitWindowedMaxFilter(filter=BBR.MaxBwFilter, value=0, time=0)
       BBR.min_rtt = SRTT ? SRTT : Infinity
       BBR.min_rtt_stamp = Now()
       BBR.probe_rtt_done_stamp = 0
       BBR.probe_rtt_round_done = false
       BBR.prior_cwnd = 0
       BBR.idle_restart = false
       BBR.extra_acked_interval_start = Now()
       BBR.extra_acked_delivered = 0
       BBR.full_bw_reached = false
       BBRResetCongestionSignals()
       BBRResetShortTermModel()
       BBRInitRoundCounting()
       BBRResetFullBW()
       BBRInitPacingRate()
       BBREnterStartup()

4.2.2.  Per-Transmit Steps

   When transmitting, BBR merely needs to check for the case where the
   flow is restarting from idle:

     BBROnTransmit():
       BBRHandleRestartFromIdle()

4.2.3.  Per-ACK Steps

   On every ACK, the BBR algorithm executes the following
   BBRUpdateOnACK() steps in order to update its network path model,
   update its state machine, and adjust its control parameters to adapt
   to the updated model:

     BBRUpdateOnACK():
       BBRUpdateModelAndState()
       BBRUpdateControlParameters()

     BBRUpdateModelAndState():
       BBRUpdateLatestDeliverySignals()
       BBRUpdateCongestionSignals()
       BBRUpdateACKAggregation()
       BBRCheckFullBWReached()
       BBRCheckStartupDone()
       BBRCheckDrainDone()
       BBRUpdateProbeBWCyclePhase()
       BBRUpdateMinRTT()
       BBRCheckProbeRTT()
       BBRAdvanceLatestDeliverySignals()
       BBRBoundBWForModel()

     BBRUpdateControlParameters():
       BBRSetPacingRate()
       BBRSetSendQuantum()
       BBRSetCwnd()

4.2.4.  Per-Loss Steps

   On every packet loss event, where some sequence range "packet" is
   marked lost, the BBR algorithm executes the following
   BBRUpdateOnLoss() steps in order to update its network path model

     BBRUpdateOnLoss(packet):
       BBRHandleLostPacket(packet)

4.3.  State Machine Operation

4.3.1.  Startup

4.3.1.1.  Startup Dynamics

   When a BBR flow starts up, it performs its first (and most rapid)
   sequential probe/drain process in the Startup and Drain states.
   Network link bandwidths currently span a range of at least 11 orders
   of magnitude, from a few bps to hundreds of Gbps.  To quickly learn
   BBR.max_bw, given this huge range to explore, BBR's Startup state
   does an exponential search of the rate space, doubling the sending
   rate each round.  This finds BBR.max_bw in O(log_2(BDP)) round trips.

   To achieve this rapid probing smoothly, in Startup BBR uses the
   minimum gain values that will allow the sending rate to double each
   round: in Startup BBR sets BBR.pacing_gain to BBRStartupPacingGain
   (2.77) [BBRStartupPacingGain] and BBR.cwnd_gain to BBRDefaultCwndGain
   (2) [BBRStartupCwndGain].

   When initializing a connection, or upon any later entry into Startup
   mode, BBR executes the following BBREnterStartup() steps:

     BBREnterStartup():
       BBR.state = Startup
       BBR.pacing_gain = BBRStartupPacingGain
       BBR.cwnd_gain = BBRDefaultCwndGain

   As BBR grows its sending rate rapidly, it obtains higher delivery
   rate samples, BBR.max_bw increases, and the pacing rate and cwnd both
   adapt by smoothly growing in proportion.  Once the pipe is full, a
   queue typically forms, but the cwnd_gain bounds any queue to
   (cwnd_gain - 1) * estimated_BDP, which is approximately (2 - 1) *
   estimated_BDP = estimated_BDP.  The immediately following Drain state
   is designed to quickly drain that queue.

   During Startup, BBR estimates whether the pipe is full using two
   estimators.  The first looks for a plateau in the BBR.max_bw
   estimate.  The second looks for packet loss.  The following
   subsections discuss these estimators.

     BBRCheckStartupDone():
       BBRCheckStartupHighLoss()
       if (BBR.state == Startup and BBR.full_bw_reached)
         BBREnterDrain()

4.3.1.2.  Exiting Acceleration Based on Bandwidth Plateau

   In phases where BBR is accelerating to probe the available bandwidth
   - Startup and ProbeBW_UP - BBR runs a state machine to estimate
   whether an accelerating sending rate has saturated the available per-
   flow bandwidth ("filled the pipe") by looking for a plateau in the
   measured rs.delivery_rate.

   BBR tracks the status of the current full-pipe estimation process in
   the boolean BBR.full_bw_now, and uses BBR.full_bw_now to exit
   ProbeBW_UP.  BBR records in the boolean BBR.full_bw_reached whether
   BBR estimates that it has ever fully utilized its available bandwidth
   (over the lifetime of the connection), and uses BBR.full_bw_reached
   to decide when to exit Startup and enter Drain.

   The full pipe estimator works as follows: if BBR counts several
   (three) non-application-limited rounds where attempts to
   significantly increase the delivery rate actually result in little
   increase (less than 25 percent), then it estimates that it has fully
   utilized the per-flow available bandwidth, and sets both
   BBR.full_bw_now and BBR.full_bw_reached to true.

   Upon starting a full pipe detection process (either on startup or
   when probing for an increase in bandwidth), the following steps are
   taken:

     BBRResetFullBW():
       BBR.full_bw = 0
       BBR.full_bw_count = 0
       BBR.full_bw_now = 0

   While running the full pipe detection process, upon an ACK that
   acknowledges new data, and when the delivery rate sample is not
   application-limited (see Section 4.6), BBR runs the "full pipe"
   estimator:

     BBRCheckFullBWReached():
       if (BBR.full_bw_now or !BBR.round_start or rs.is_app_limited)
         return  /* no need to check for a full pipe now */
       if (rs.delivery_rate >= BBR.full_bw * 1.25)
         BBRResetFullBW()       /* bw is still growing, so reset */
         BBR.full_bw = rs.delivery_rate  /* record new baseline bw */
         return
       BBR.full_bw_count++   /* another round w/o much growth */
       BBR.full_bw_now = (BBR.full_bw_count >= 3)
       if (BBR.full_bw_now)
         BBR.full_bw_reached = true

   BBR waits three packet-timed round trips to have reasonable evidence
   that the sender is not detecting a delivery-rate plateau that was
   temporarily imposed by congestion or receive-window auto-tuning.
   This three-round threshold was validated by experimental data to
   allow the receiver the chance to grow its receive window.

4.3.1.3.  Exiting Startup Based on Packet Loss

   A second method BBR uses for estimating the bottleneck is full in
   Startup is by looking at packet losses.  Specifically,
   BBRCheckStartupHighLoss() checks whether all of the following
   criteria are all met:

   *  The connection has been in fast recovery for at least one full
      packet-timed round trip.

   *  The loss rate over the time scale of a single full round trip
      exceeds BBRLossThresh (2%).

   *  There are at least BBRStartupFullLossCnt=6 discontiguous sequence
      ranges lost in that round trip.

   If these criteria are all met, then BBRCheckStartupHighLoss() takes
   the following steps.  First, it sets BBR.full_bw_reached = true.
   Then it sets BBR.inflight_longterm to its estimate of a safe level of
   in-flight data suggested by these losses, which is max(BBR.bdp,
   BBR.inflight_latest), where BBR.inflight_latest is the max delivered
   volume of data (rs.delivered) over the last round trip.  Finally, it
   exits Startup and enters Drain.

   The algorithm waits until all three criteria are met to filter out
   noise from burst losses, and to try to ensure the bottleneck is fully
   utilized on a sustained basis, and the full bottleneck bandwidth has
   been measured, before attempting to drain the level of in-flight data
   to the estimated BDP.

4.3.2.  Drain

   Upon exiting Startup, BBR enters its Drain state.  In Drain, BBR aims
   to quickly drain any queue at the bottleneck link that was created in
   Startup by switching to a pacing_gain well below 1.0, until any
   estimated queue has been drained.  It uses a pacing_gain of
   BBRDrainPacingGain = 0.35, chosen via analysis [BBRDrainPacingGain]
   and experimentation to try to drain the queue in less than one round-
   trip:

     BBREnterDrain():
       BBR.state = Drain
       BBR.pacing_gain = BBRDrainPacingGain    /* pace slowly */
       BBR.cwnd_gain = BBRDefaultCwndGain      /* maintain cwnd */

   In Drain, when the amount of data in flight is less than or equal to
   the estimated BDP, meaning BBR estimates that the queue at the
   bottleneck link has been fully drained, then BBR exits Drain and
   enters ProbeBW.  To implement this, upon every ACK BBR executes:

     BBRCheckDrainDone():
       if (BBR.state == Drain and C.pipe <= BBRInflight(1.0))
         BBREnterProbeBW()  /* BBR estimates the queue was drained */

4.3.3.  ProbeBW

   Long-lived BBR flows tend to spend the vast majority of their time in
   the ProbeBW states.  In the ProbeBW states, a BBR flow sequentially
   accelerates, decelerates, and cruises, to measure the network path,
   improve its operating point (increase throughput and reduce queue
   pressure), and converge toward a more fair allocation of bottleneck
   bandwidth.  To do this, the flow sequentially cycles through all
   three tactics: trying to send faster than, slower than, and at the
   same rate as the network delivery process.  To achieve this, a BBR
   flow in ProbeBW mode cycles through the four Probe bw states (DOWN,
   CRUISE, REFILL, and UP) described below in turn.

4.3.3.1.  ProbeBW_DOWN

   In the ProbeBW_DOWN phase of the cycle, a BBR flow pursues the
   deceleration tactic, to try to send slower than the network is
   delivering data, to reduce the amount of data in flight, with all of
   the standard motivations for the deceleration tactic (discussed in
   "State Machine Tactics" in Section 4.1.3).  It does this by switching
   to a BBR.pacing_gain of 0.90, sending at 90% of BBR.bw.  The
   pacing_gain value of 0.90 is derived based on the ProbeBW_UP pacing
   gain of 1.25, as the minimum pacing_gain value that allows bandwidth-
   based convergence to approximate fairness, and validated through
   experiments.

   Exit conditions: The flow exits the ProbeBW_DOWN phase and enters
   CRUISE when the flow estimates that both of the following conditions
   have been met:

   *  There is free headroom: If inflight_longterm is set, then BBR
      remains in ProbeBW_DOWN at least until the volume of in-flight
      data is less than or equal to a target calculated based on (1 -
      BBRHeadroom)*BBR.inflight_longterm.  The goal of this constraint
      is to ensure that in cases where loss signals suggest an upper
      limit on the volume of in-flight data, then the flow attempts to
      leave some free headroom in the path (e.g. free space in the
      bottleneck buffer or free time slots in the bottleneck link) that
      can be used by cross traffic (both for convergence of bandwidth
      shares and for burst tolerance).

   *  The volume of in-flight data is less than or equal to BBR.bdp,
      i.e. the flow estimates that it has drained any queue at the
      bottleneck.

4.3.3.2.  ProbeBW_CRUISE

   In the ProbeBW_CRUISE phase of the cycle, a BBR flow pursues the
   "cruising" tactic (discussed in "State Machine Tactics" in
   Section 4.1.3), attempting to send at the same rate the network is
   delivering data.  It tries to match the sending rate to the flow's
   current available bandwidth, to try to achieve high utilization of
   the available bandwidth without increasing queue pressure.  It does
   this by switching to a pacing_gain of 1.0, sending at 100% of BBR.bw.
   Notably, while in this state it responds to concrete congestion
   signals (loss) by reducing BBR.bw_shortterm and
   BBR.inflight_shortterm, because these signals suggest that the
   available bandwidth and deliverable volume of in-flight data have
   likely reduced, and the flow needs to change to adapt, slowing down
   to match the latest delivery process.

   Exit conditions: The connection adaptively holds this state until it
   decides that it is time to probe for bandwidth (see "Time Scale for
   Bandwidth Probing", in Section 4.3.3.5), at which time it enters
   ProbeBW_REFILL.

4.3.3.3.  ProbeBW_REFILL

   The goal of the ProbeBW_REFILL state is to "refill the pipe", to try
   to fully utilize the network bottleneck without creating any
   significant queue pressure.

   To do this, BBR first resets the short-term model parameters
   bw_shortterm and inflight_shortterm, setting both to "Infinity".
   This is the key moment in the BBR time scale strategy (see "Time
   Scale Strategy", Section 3.4.2.3) where the flow pivots, discarding
   its conservative short-term bw_shortterm and inflight_shortterm
   parameters and beginning to robustly probe the bottleneck's long-term
   available bandwidth.  During this time the estimated bandwidth and
   inflight_longterm, if set, constrain the connection.

   During ProbeBW_REFILL BBR uses a BBR.pacing_gain of 1.0, to send at a
   rate that matches the current estimated available bandwidth, for one
   packet-timed round trip.  The goal is to fully utilize the bottleneck
   link before transitioning into ProbeBW_UP and significantly
   increasing the chances of causing loss.  The motivating insight is
   that, as soon as a flow starts acceleration, sending faster than the
   available bandwidth, it will start building a queue at the
   bottleneck.  And if the buffer is shallow enough, then the flow can
   cause loss signals very shortly after the first accelerating packets
   arrive at the bottleneck.  If the flow were to neglect to fill the
   pipe before it causes this loss signal, then these very quick signals
   of excess queue could cause the flow's estimate of the path's
   capacity (i.e. inflight_longterm) to significantly underestimate.  In
   particular, if the flow were to transition directly from
   ProbeBW_CRUISE to ProbeBW_UP, the volume of in-flight data (at the
   time the first accelerating packets were sent) may often be still
   very close to the volume of in-flight data maintained in CRUISE,
   which may be only (1 - BBRHeadroom)*inflight_longterm.

   Exit conditions: The flow exits ProbeBW_REFILL after one packet-timed
   round trip, and enters ProbeBW_UP.  This is because after one full
   round trip of sending in ProbeBW_REFILL the flow (if not application-
   limited) has had an opportunity to place as many packets in flight as
   its BBR.bw and inflight_longterm permit.  Correspondingly, at this
   point the flow starts to see bandwidth samples reflecting its
   ProbeBW_REFILL behavior, which may be putting too much data in
   flight.

4.3.3.4.  ProbeBW_UP

   After ProbeBW_REFILL refills the pipe, ProbeBW_UP probes for possible
   increases in available bandwidth by raising the sending rate, using a
   BBR.pacing_gain of 1.25, to send faster than the current estimated
   available bandwidth.  It also raises the cwnd_gain to 2.25, to ensure
   that the flow can send faster than it had been, even if cwnd was
   previously limiting the sending process.

   If the flow has not set BBR.inflight_longterm, it implicitly tries to
   raise the volume of in-flight data to at least BBR.pacing_gain *
   BBR.bdp = 1.25 * BBR.bdp.

   If the flow has set BBR.inflight_longterm and encounters that limit,
   it then gradually increases the upper volume bound
   (BBR.inflight_longterm) using the following approach:

   *  inflight_longterm: The flow raises inflight_longterm in ProbeBW_UP
      in a manner that is slow and cautious at first, but increasingly
      rapid and bold over time.  The initial caution is motivated by the
      fact that a given BBR flow may be sharing a shallow buffer with
      thousands of other flows, so that the buffer space available to
      the flow may be quite tight (even just a single packet or less).
      The increasingly rapid growth over time is motivated by the fact
      that in a high-speed WAN the increase in available bandwidth (and
      thus the estimated BDP) may require the flow to grow the volume of
      its inflight data by up to O(1,000,000) packets; even a high-speed
      WAN BDP like 10Gbps * 100ms is around 83,000 packets (with a
      1500-byte MTU).  The additive increase to BBR.inflight_longterm
      exponentially doubles each round trip; in each successive round
      trip, inflight_longterm grows by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc, with the
      increases spread uniformly across the entire round trip.  This
      helps allow BBR to utilize a larger BDP in O(log(BDP)) round
      trips, meeting the design goal for scalable utilization of newly-
      available bandwidth.

   Exit conditions: The BBR flow ends ProbeBW_UP bandwidth probing and
   transitions to ProbeBW_DOWN to try to drain the bottleneck queue when
   either of the following conditions are met:

   1.  Bandwidth saturation: BBRIsTimeToGoDown() (see below) uses the
       "full pipe" estimator (see Section 4.3.1.2) to estimate whether
       the flow has saturated the available per-flow bandwidth ("filled
       the pipe"), by looking for a plateau in the measured
       rs.delivery_rate.  If, during this process, the volume of data is
       constrained by BBR.inflight_longterm (the flow becomes cwnd-
       limited while cwnd is limited by BBR.inflight_longterm), then the
       flow cannot fully explore the available bandwidth, and so it
       resets the "full pipe" estimator by calling BBRResetFullBW().

   2.  Loss: The current loss rate, over the time scale of the last
       round trip, exceeds BBRLossThresh (2%).

4.3.3.5.  Time Scale for Bandwidth Probing

   Choosing the time scale for probing bandwidth is tied to the question
   of how to coexist with legacy Reno/CUBIC flows, since probing for
   bandwidth runs a significant risk of causing packet loss, and causing
   packet loss can significantly limit the throughput of such legacy
   Reno/CUBIC flows.

4.3.3.5.1.  Bandwidth Probing and Coexistence with Reno/CUBIC

   BBR has an explicit strategy for coexistence with Reno/CUBIC: to try
   to behave in a manner so that Reno/CUBIC flows coexisting with BBR
   can continue to work well in the primary contexts where they do
   today:

   *  Intra-datacenter/LAN traffic: the goal is to allow Reno/CUBIC to
      be able to perform well in 100M through 40G enterprise and
      datacenter Ethernet:

      -  BDP = 40 Gbps * 20 us / (1514 bytes) ~= 66 packets

   *  Public Internet last mile traffic: the goal is to allow Reno/CUBIC
      to be able to support up to 25Mbps (for 4K Video) at an RTT of
      30ms, typical parameters for common CDNs for large video services:

      -  BDP = 25Mbps * 30 ms / (1514 bytes) ~= 62 packets

   The challenge in meeting these goals is that Reno/CUBIC need long
   periods of no loss to utilize large BDPs.  The good news is that in
   the environments where Reno/CUBIC work well today (mentioned above),
   the BDPs are small, roughly ~100 packets or less.

4.3.3.5.2.  A Dual-Time-Scale Approach for Coexistence

   The BBR strategy has several aspects:

   1.  The highest priority is to estimate the bandwidth available to
       the BBR flow in question.

   2.  Secondarily, a given BBR flow adapts (within bounds) the
       frequency at which it probes bandwidth and knowingly risks packet
       loss, to allow Reno/CUBIC to reach a bandwidth at least as high
       as that given BBR flow.

   To adapt the frequency of bandwidth probing, BBR considers two time
   scales: a BBR-native time scale, and a bounded Reno-conscious time
   scale:

   *  T_bbr: BBR-native time-scale

      -  T_bbr = uniformly randomly distributed between 2 and 3 secs

   *  T_reno: Reno-coexistence time scale

      -  T_reno_bound = pick_randomly_either({62, 63})

      -  reno_bdp = min(BBR.bdp, cwnd)

      -  T_reno = min(reno_bdp, T_reno_bound) round trips

   *  T_probe: The time between bandwidth probe UP phases:

      -  T_probe = min(T_bbr, T_reno)

   This dual-time-scale approach is similar to that used by CUBIC, which
   has a CUBIC-native time scale given by a cubic curve, and a "Reno
   emulation" module that estimates what cwnd would give the flow Reno-
   equivalent throughput.  At any given moment, CUBIC choose the cwnd
   implied by the more aggressive strategy.

   We randomize both the T_bbr and T_reno parameters, for better mixing
   and fairness convergence.

4.3.3.5.3.  Design Considerations for Choosing Constant Parameters

   We design the maximum wall-clock bounds of BBR-native inter-
   bandwidth-probe wall clock time, T_bbr, to be:

   *  Higher than 2 sec to try to avoid causing loss for a long enough
      time to allow Reno flow with RTT=30ms to get 25Mbps (4K video)
      throughput.  For this workload, given the Reno sawtooth that
      raises cwnd from roughly BDP to 2*BDP, one SMSS per round trip,
      the inter-bandwidth-probe time must be at least: BDP * RTT =
      25Mbps * .030 sec / (1514 bytes) * 0.030 sec = 1.9secs

   *  Lower than 3 sec to ensure flows can start probing in a reasonable
      amount of time to discover unutilized bw on human-scale
      interactive time-scales (e.g. perhaps traffic from a competing web
      page download is now complete).

   The maximum round-trip bounds of the Reno-coexistence time scale,
   T_reno, are chosen to be 62-63 with the following considerations in
   mind:

   *  Choosing a value smaller than roughly 60 would imply that when BBR
      flows coexisted with Reno/CUBIC flows on public Internet broadband
      links, the Reno/CUBIC flows would not be able to achieve enough
      bandwidth to show 4K video.

   *  Choosing a value that is too large would prevent BBR from reaching
      its goal of tolerating 1% loss per round trip.  Given that the
      steady-state (non-bandwidth-probing) BBR response to a non-
      application-limited round trip with X% packet loss is to reduce
      the sending rate by X% (see "Updating the Model Upon Packet Loss"
      in Section 4.6.11), this means that the BBR sending rate after N
      rounds of packet loss at a rate loss_rate is reduced to (1 -
      loss_rate)^N.  A simplified model predicts that for a flow that
      encounters 1% loss in N=137 round trips of ProbeBW_CRUISE, and
      then doubles its cwnd (back to BBR.inflight_longterm) in
      ProbeBW_REFILL and ProbeBW_UP, we expect that it will be able to
      restore and reprobe its original sending rate, since: (1 -
      loss_rate)^N * 2^2 = (1 - .01)^137 * 2^2 ~= 1.01.  That is, we
      expect the flow will be able to fully respond to packet loss
      signals in ProbeBW_CRUISE while also fully re-measuring its
      maximum achievable throughput in ProbeBW_UP.  However, with a
      larger number of round trips of ProbeBW_CRUISE, the flow would not
      be able to sustain its achievable throughput.

   The resulting behavior is that for BBR flows with small BDPs, the
   bandwidth probing will be on roughly the same time scale as Reno/
   CUBIC; flows with large BDPs will intentionally probe more rapidly/
   frequently than Reno/CUBIC would (roughly every 62 round trips for
   low-RTT flows, or 2-3 secs for high-RTT flows).

   The considerations above for timing bandwidth probing can be
   implemented as follows:

     /* Is it time to transition from DOWN or CRUISE to REFILL? */
     BBRIsTimeToProbeBW():
       if (BBRHasElapsedInPhase(BBR.bw_probe_wait) ||
           BBRIsRenoCoexistenceProbeTime())
         BBRStartProbeBW_REFILL()
         return true
       return false

     /* Randomized decision about how long to wait until
      * probing for bandwidth, using round count and wall clock.
      */
     BBRPickProbeWait():
       /* Decide random round-trip bound for wait: */
       BBR.rounds_since_bw_probe =
         random_int_between(0, 1); /* 0 or 1 */
       /* Decide the random wall clock bound for wait: */
       BBR.bw_probe_wait =
         2 + random_float_between(0.0, 1.0) /* 0..1 sec */

     BBRIsRenoCoexistenceProbeTime():
       reno_rounds = BBRTargetInflight()
       rounds = min(reno_rounds, 63)
       return BBR.rounds_since_bw_probe >= rounds

     /* How much data do we want in flight?
      * Our estimated BDP, unless congestion cut cwnd. */
     BBRTargetInflight()
       return min(BBR.bdp, cwnd)

4.3.3.6.  ProbeBW Algorithm Details

   BBR's ProbeBW algorithm operates as follows.

   Upon entering ProbeBW, BBR executes:

     BBREnterProbeBW():
       BBR.cwnd_gain = BBRDefaultCwndGain
       BBRStartProbeBW_DOWN()

   The core logic for entering each state:

     BBRStartProbeBW_DOWN():
       BBRResetCongestionSignals()
       BBR.probe_up_cnt = Infinity /* not growing inflight_longterm */
       BBRPickProbeWait()
       BBR.cycle_stamp = Now()  /* start wall clock */
       BBR.ack_phase  = ACKS_PROBE_STOPPING
       BBRStartRound()
       BBR.state = ProbeBW_DOWN

     BBRStartProbeBW_CRUISE():
       BBR.state = ProbeBW_CRUISE

     BBRStartProbeBW_REFILL():
       BBRResetShortTermModel()
       BBR.bw_probe_up_rounds = 0
       BBR.bw_probe_up_acks = 0
       BBR.ack_phase = ACKS_REFILLING
       BBRStartRound()
       BBR.state = ProbeBW_REFILL

     BBRStartProbeBW_UP():
       BBR.ack_phase = ACKS_PROBE_STARTING
       BBRStartRound()
       BBRResetFullBW()
       BBR.full_bw = rs.delivery_rate
       BBR.state = ProbeBW_UP
       BBRRaiseInflightLongtermSlope()

   BBR executes the following BBRUpdateProbeBWCyclePhase() logic on each
   ACK that acknowledges new data, to advance the ProbeBW state machine:

     /* The core state machine logic for ProbeBW: */
     BBRUpdateProbeBWCyclePhase():
       if (!BBR.full_bw_reached)
         return  /* only handling steady-state behavior here */
       BBRAdaptLongTermModel()
       if (!IsInAProbeBWState())
         return /* only handling ProbeBW states here: */

       switch (state)

       ProbeBW_DOWN:
         if (BBRIsTimeToProbeBW())
           return /* already decided state transition */
         if (BBRIsTimeToCruise())
           BBRStartProbeBW_CRUISE()

       ProbeBW_CRUISE:
         if (BBRIsTimeToProbeBW())
           return /* already decided state transition */

       ProbeBW_REFILL:
         /* After one round of REFILL, start UP */
         if (BBR.round_start)
           BBR.bw_probe_samples = 1
           BBRStartProbeBW_UP()

       ProbeBW_UP:
         if (BBRIsTimeToGoDown())
           BBRStartProbeBW_DOWN()

   The ancillary logic to implement the ProbeBW state machine:

4.3.4.  ProbeRTT

4.3.4.1.  ProbeRTT Overview

   To help probe for BBR.min_rtt, on an as-needed basis BBR flows enter
   the ProbeRTT state to try to cooperate to periodically drain the
   bottleneck queue, and thus improve their BBR.min_rtt estimate of the
   unloaded two-way propagation delay.

   A critical point is that before BBR raises its BBR.min_rtt estimate
   (which would in turn raise its maximum permissible cwnd), it first
   enters ProbeRTT to try to make a concerted and coordinated effort to
   drain the bottleneck queue and make a robust BBR.min_rtt measurement.
   This allows the BBR.min_rtt estimates of ensembles of BBR flows to
   converge, avoiding feedback loops of ever-increasing queues and RTT
   samples.

   The ProbeRTT state works in concert with BBR.min_rtt estimation.  Up
   to once every ProbeRTTInterval = 5 seconds, the flow enters ProbeRTT,
   decelerating by setting its cwnd_gain to BBRProbeRTTCwndGain = 0.5 to
   reduce its volume of inflight data to half of its estimated BDP, to
   try to measure the unloaded two-way propagation delay.

   There are two main motivations for making the MinRTTFilterLen roughly
   twice the ProbeRTTInterval.  First, this ensures that during a
   ProbeRTT episode the flow will "remember" the BBR.min_rtt value it
   measured during the previous ProbeRTT episode, providing a robust BDP
   estimate for the cwnd = 0.5*BDP calculation, increasing the
   likelihood of fully draining the bottleneck queue.  Second, this
   allows the flow's BBR.min_rtt filter window to generally include RTT
   samples from two ProbeTT episodes, providing a more robust estimate.

   The algorithm for ProbeRTT is as follows:

   Entry conditions: In any state other than ProbeRTT itself, if the
   BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay estimate has not been updated (i.e., by
   getting a lower RTT measurement) for more than ProbeRTTInterval = 5
   seconds, then BBR enters ProbeRTT and reduces the BBR.cwnd_gain to
   BBRProbeRTTCwndGain = 0.5.

   Exit conditions: After maintaining the volume of in-flight data at
   BBRProbeRTTCwndGain*BBR.bdp for at least ProbeRTTDuration (200 ms)
   and at least one packet-timed round trip, BBR leaves ProbeRTT and
   transitions to ProbeBW if it estimates the pipe was filled already,
   or Startup otherwise.

4.3.4.2.  ProbeRTT Design Rationale

   BBR is designed to have ProbeRTT sacrifice no more than roughly 2% of
   a flow's available bandwidth.  It is also designed to spend the vast
   majority of its time (at least roughly 96 percent) in ProbeBW and the
   rest in ProbeRTT, based on a set of tradeoffs.  ProbeRTT lasts long
   enough (at least ProbeRTTDuration = 200 ms) to allow diverse flows
   (e.g., flows with different RTTs or lower rates and thus longer
   inter-packet gaps) to have overlapping ProbeRTT states, while still
   being short enough to bound the throughput penalty of ProbeRTT's cwnd
   capping to roughly 2%, with the average throughput targeted at:

     throughput = (200ms*0.5*BBR.bw + (5s - 200ms)*BBR.bw) / 5s
                = (.1s + 4.8s)/5s * BBR.bw = 0.98 * BBR.bw

   As discussed above, BBR's BBR.min_rtt filter window, MinRTTFilterLen,
   and time interval between ProbeRTT states, ProbeRTTInterval, work in
   concert.  BBR uses a MinRTTFilterLen equal to or longer than
   ProbeRTTInterval to allow the filter window to include at least one
   ProbeRTT.

   To allow coordination with other BBR flows, each BBR flow MUST use
   the standard ProbeRTTInterval of 5 secs.

   A ProbeRTTInterval of 5 secs is short enough to allow quick
   convergence if traffic levels or routes change, but long enough so
   that interactive applications (e.g., Web, remote procedure calls,
   video chunks) often have natural silences or low-rate periods within
   the window where the flow's rate is low enough for long enough to
   drain its queue in the bottleneck.  Then the BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay
   filter opportunistically picks up these measurements, and the
   BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay estimate refreshes without requiring
   ProbeRTT.  This way, flows typically need only pay the 2 percent
   throughput penalty if there are multiple bulk flows busy sending over
   the entire ProbeRTTInterval window.

   As an optimization, when restarting from idle and finding that the
   BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay has expired, BBR does not enter ProbeRTT; the
   idleness is deemed a sufficient attempt to coordinate to drain the
   queue.

4.3.4.3.  Calculating the rs.rtt RTT Sample

   Upon transmitting each packet, BBR or the associated transport
   protocol stores in per-packet data the wall-clock scheduled
   transmission time of the packet in packet.departure_time (see "Pacing
   Rate: BBR.pacing_rate" in Section 4.7.2 for how this is calculated).

   For every ACK that newly acknowledges data, the sender's BBR
   implementation or the associated transport protocol implementation
   attempts to calculate an RTT sample.  The sender MUST consider any
   potential retransmission ambiguities that can arise in some transport
   protocols.  If some of the acknowledged data was not retransmitted,
   or some of the data was retransmitted but the sender can still
   unambiguously determine the RTT of the data (e.g. QUIC or TCP with
   timestamps [RFC7323]), then the sender calculates an RTT sample,
   rs.rtt, as follows:

     rs.rtt = Now() - packet.departure_time

4.3.4.4.  ProbeRTT Logic

   On every ACK BBR executes BBRUpdateMinRTT() to update its ProbeRTT
   scheduling state (BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay and
   BBR.probe_rtt_min_stamp) and its BBR.min_rtt estimate:

     BBRUpdateMinRTT()
       BBR.probe_rtt_expired =
         Now() > BBR.probe_rtt_min_stamp + ProbeRTTInterval
       if (rs.rtt >= 0 and
           (rs.rtt < BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay or
            BBR.probe_rtt_expired))
          BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay = rs.rtt
          BBR.probe_rtt_min_stamp = Now()

       min_rtt_expired =
         Now() > BBR.min_rtt_stamp + MinRTTFilterLen
       if (BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay < BBR.min_rtt or
           min_rtt_expired)
         BBR.min_rtt       = BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay
         BBR.min_rtt_stamp = BBR.probe_rtt_min_stamp

   Here BBR.probe_rtt_expired is a boolean recording whether the
   BBR.probe_rtt_min_delay has expired and is due for a refresh, via
   either an application idle period or a transition into ProbeRTT
   state.

   On every ACK BBR executes BBRCheckProbeRTT() to handle the steps
   related to the ProbeRTT state as follows:

     BBRCheckProbeRTT():
       if (BBR.state != ProbeRTT and
           BBR.probe_rtt_expired and
           not BBR.idle_restart)
         BBREnterProbeRTT()
         BBRSaveCwnd()
         BBR.probe_rtt_done_stamp = 0
         BBR.ack_phase = ACKS_PROBE_STOPPING
         BBRStartRound()
       if (BBR.state == ProbeRTT)
         BBRHandleProbeRTT()
       if (rs.delivered > 0)
         BBR.idle_restart = false

     BBREnterProbeRTT():
       BBR.state = ProbeRTT
       BBR.pacing_gain = 1
       BBR.cwnd_gain = BBRProbeRTTCwndGain  /* 0.5 */

     BBRHandleProbeRTT():
       /* Ignore low rate samples during ProbeRTT: */
       MarkConnectionAppLimited()
       if (BBR.probe_rtt_done_stamp == 0 and
           C.pipe <= BBRProbeRTTCwnd())
         /* Wait for at least ProbeRTTDuration to elapse: */
         BBR.probe_rtt_done_stamp =
           Now() + ProbeRTTDuration
         /* Wait for at least one round to elapse: */
         BBR.probe_rtt_round_done = false
         BBRStartRound()
       else if (BBR.probe_rtt_done_stamp != 0)
         if (BBR.round_start)
           BBR.probe_rtt_round_done = true
         if (BBR.probe_rtt_round_done)
           BBRCheckProbeRTTDone()

     BBRCheckProbeRTTDone():
       if (BBR.probe_rtt_done_stamp != 0 and
           Now() > BBR.probe_rtt_done_stamp)
         /* schedule next ProbeRTT: */
         BBR.probe_rtt_min_stamp = Now()
         BBRRestoreCwnd()
         BBRExitProbeRTT()

     MarkConnectionAppLimited():
       C.app_limited =
         (C.delivered + C.pipe) ? : 1

4.3.4.5.  Exiting ProbeRTT

   When exiting ProbeRTT, BBR transitions to ProbeBW if it estimates the
   pipe was filled already, or Startup otherwise.

   When transitioning out of ProbeRTT, BBR calls
   BBRResetShortTermModel() to reset the short-term model, since any
   congestion encountered in ProbeRTT may have pulled it far below the
   capacity of the path.

   But the algorithm is cautious in timing the next bandwidth probe:
   raising inflight after ProbeRTT may cause loss, so the algorithm
   resets the bandwidth-probing clock by starting the cycle at
   ProbeBW_DOWN().  But then as an optimization, since the connection is
   exiting ProbeRTT, we know that infligh is already below the estimated
   BDP, so the connection can proceed immediately to ProbeBW_CRUISE.

   To summarize, the logic for exiting ProbeRTT is as follows:

     BBRExitProbeRTT():
       BBRResetShortTermModel()
       if (BBR.full_bw_reached)
         BBRStartProbeBW_DOWN()
         BBRStartProbeBW_CRUISE()
       else
         BBREnterStartup()

4.4.  Restarting From Idle

4.4.1.  Actions when Restarting from Idle

   When restarting from idle in ProbeBW states, BBR leaves its cwnd as-
   is and paces packets at exactly BBR.bw, aiming to return as quickly
   as possible to its target operating point of rate balance and a full
   pipe.  Specifically, if the flow's BBR.state is ProbeBW, and the flow
   is application-limited, and there are no packets in flight currently,
   then before the flow sends one or more packets BBR sets
   BBR.pacing_rate to exactly BBR.bw.

   Also, when restarting from idle BBR checks to see if the connection
   is in ProbeRTT and has met the exit conditions for ProbeRTT.  If a
   connection goes idle during ProbeRTT then often it will have met
   those exit conditions by the time it restarts, so that the connection
   can restore the cwnd to its full value before it starts transmitting
   a new flight of data.

   More precisely, the BBR algorithm takes the following steps in
   BBRHandleRestartFromIdle() before sending a packet for a flow:

     BBRHandleRestartFromIdle():
       if (C.pipe == 0 and C.app_limited)
         BBR.idle_restart = true
         BBR.extra_acked_interval_start = Now()
         if (IsInAProbeBWState())
           BBRSetPacingRateWithGain(1)
         else if (BBR.state == ProbeRTT)
           BBRCheckProbeRTTDone()

4.4.2.  Comparison with Previous Approaches

   The "Restarting Idle Connections" section of [RFC5681] suggests
   restarting from idle by slow-starting from the initial window.
   However, this approach was assuming a congestion control algorithm
   that had no estimate of the bottleneck bandwidth and no pacing, and
   thus resorted to relying on slow-starting driven by an ACK clock.
   The long (log_2(BDP)*RTT) delays required to reach full utilization
   with that "slow start after idle" approach caused many large
   deployments to disable this mechanism, resulting in a "BDP-scale
   line-rate burst" approach instead.  Instead of these two approaches,
   BBR restarts by pacing at BBR.bw, typically achieving approximate
   rate balance and a full pipe after only one BBR.min_rtt has elapsed.

4.5.  Updating Network Path Model Parameters

   BBR is a model-based congestion control algorithm: it is based on an
   explicit model of the network path over which a transport flow
   travels.  The following is a summary of each parameter, including its
   meaning and how the algorithm calculates and uses its value.  We can
   group the parameter into three groups:

   *  core state machine parameters

   *  parameters to model the data rate

   *  parameters to model the volume of in-flight data

4.5.1.  BBR.round_count: Tracking Packet-Timed Round Trips

   Several aspects of BBR depend on counting the progress of "packet-
   timed" round trips, which start at the transmission of some segment,
   and then end at the acknowledgement of that segment.  BBR.round_count
   is a count of the number of these "packet-timed" round trips elapsed
   so far.  BBR uses this virtual BBR.round_count because it is more
   robust than using wall clock time.  In particular, arbitrary
   intervals of wall clock time can elapse due to application idleness,
   variations in RTTs, or timer delays for retransmission timeouts,
   causing wall-clock-timed model parameter estimates to "time out" or
   to be "forgotten" too quickly to provide robustness.

   BBR counts packet-timed round trips by recording state about a
   sentinel packet, and waiting for an ACK of any data packet that was
   sent after that sentinel packet, using the following pseudocode:

   Upon connection initialization:

     BBRInitRoundCounting():
       BBR.next_round_delivered = 0
       BBR.round_start = false
       BBR.round_count = 0

   Upon sending each packet, the rate estimation algorithm in
   Section 4.6 records the amount of data thus far acknowledged as
   delivered:

     packet.delivered = C.delivered

   Upon receiving an ACK for a given data packet, the rate estimation
   algorithm in Section 4.6 updates the amount of data thus far
   acknowledged as delivered:

       C.delivered += packet.size

   Upon receiving an ACK for a given data packet, the BBR algorithm
   first executes the following logic to see if a round trip has
   elapsed, and if so, increment the count of such round trips elapsed:

     BBRUpdateRound():
       if (packet.delivered >= BBR.next_round_delivered)
         BBRStartRound()
         BBR.round_count++
         BBR.rounds_since_bw_probe++
         BBR.round_start = true
       else
         BBR.round_start = false

     BBRStartRound():
       BBR.next_round_delivered = C.delivered

4.5.2.  BBR.max_bw: Estimated Maximum Bandwidth

   BBR.max_bw is BBR's estimate of the maximum bottleneck bandwidth
   available to data transmissions for the transport flow.  At any time,
   a transport connection's data transmissions experience some slowest
   link or bottleneck.  The bottleneck's delivery rate determines the
   connection's maximum data-delivery rate.  BBR tries to closely match
   its sending rate to this bottleneck delivery rate to help seek "rate
   balance", where the flow's packet arrival rate at the bottleneck
   equals the departure rate.  The bottleneck rate varies over the life
   of a connection, so BBR continually estimates BBR.max_bw using recent
   signals.

4.6.  Delivery Rate Samples

   This section describes a generic algorithm for a transport protocol
   sender to estimate the current delivery rate of its data on the fly.
   This technique is used by BBR to get fresh, reliable, and inexpensive
   delivery rate information.

   At a high level, the algorithm estimates the rate at which the
   network delivered the most recent flight of outbound data packets for
   a single flow.  In addition, it tracks whether the rate sample was
   application-limited, meaning the transmission rate was limited by the
   sending application rather than the congestion control algorithm.

   Each acknowledgment that cumulatively or selectively acknowledges
   that the network has delivered new data produces a rate sample which
   records the amount of data delivered over the time interval between
   the transmission of a data packet and the acknowledgment of that
   packet.  The samples reflect the recent goodput through some
   bottleneck, which may reside either in the network or on the end
   hosts (sender or receiver).

4.6.1.  Delivery Rate Sampling Algorithm Overview

4.6.1.1.  Requirements

   This algorithm can be implemented in any transport protocol that
   supports packet-delivery acknowledgment (so far, implementations are
   available for TCP [RFC9293] and QUIC [RFC9000]).  This algorithm
   requires a small amount of added logic on the sender, and requires
   that the sender maintain a small amount of additional per-packet
   state for packets sent but not yet delivered.  In the most general
   case it requires high-precision (microsecond-granularity or better)
   timestamps on the sender (though millisecond-granularity may suffice
   for lower bandwidths).  It does not require any receiver or network
   changes.  While selective acknowledgments for out-of-order data
   (e.g., [RFC2018]) are not required, such a mechanism is highly
   recommended for accurate estimation during reordering and loss
   recovery phases.

4.6.1.2.  Estimating Delivery Rate

   A delivery rate sample records the estimated rate at which the
   network delivered packets for a single flow, calculated over the time
   interval between the transmission of a data packet and the
   acknowledgment of that packet.  Since the rate samples only include
   packets actually cumulatively and/or selectively acknowledged, the
   sender knows the exact octets that were delivered to the receiver
   (not lost), and the sender can compute an estimate of a bottleneck
   delivery rate over that time interval.

   The amount of data delivered MAY be tracked in units of either octets
   or packets.  Tracking data in units of octets is more accurate, since
   packet sizes can vary.  But for some purposes, including congestion
   control, tracking data in units of packets may suffice.

4.6.1.2.1.  ACK Rate

   First, consider the rate at which data is acknowledged by the
   receiver.  In this algorithm, the computation of the ACK rate models
   the average slope of a hypothetical "delivered" curve that tracks the
   cumulative quantity of data delivered so far on the Y axis, and time
   elapsed on the X axis.  Since ACKs arrive in discrete events, this
   "delivered" curve forms a step function, where each ACK causes a
   discrete increase in the "delivered" count that causes a vertical
   upward step up in the curve.  This "ack_rate" computation is the
   average slope of the "delivered" step function, as measured from the
   "knee" of the step (ACK) preceding the transmit to the "knee" of the
   step (ACK) for packet P.

   Given this model, the ack rate sample "slope" is computed as the
   ratio between the amount of data marked as delivered over this time
   interval, and the time over which it is marked as delivered:

     ack_rate = data_acked / ack_elapsed

   To calculate the amount of data ACKed over the interval, the sender
   records in per-packet state "P.delivered", the amount of data that
   had been marked delivered before transmitting packet P, and then
   records how much data had been marked delivered by the time the ACK
   for the packet arrives (in "C.delivered"), and computes the
   difference:

     data_acked = C.delivered - P.delivered

   To compute the time interval, "ack_elapsed", one might imagine that
   it would be feasible to use the round-trip time (RTT) of the packet.
   But it is not safe to simply calculate a bandwidth estimate by using
   the time between the transmit of a packet and the acknowledgment of
   that packet.  Transmits and ACKs can happen out of phase with each
   other, clocked in separate processes.  In general, transmissions
   often happen at some point later than the most recent ACK, due to
   processing or pacing delays.  Because of this effect, drastic over-
   estimates can happen if a sender were to attempt to estimate
   bandwidth by using the round-trip time.

   The following approach computes "ack_elapsed".  The starting time is
   "P.delivered_time", the time of the delivery curve "knee" from the
   ACK preceding the transmit.  The ending time is "C.delivered_time",
   the time of the delivery curve "knee" from the ACK for P.  Then we
   compute "ack_elapsed" as:

     ack_elapsed = C.delivered_time - P.delivered_time

   This yields our equation for computing the ACK rate, as the "slope"
   from the "knee" preceding the transmit to the "knee" at ACK:

     ack_rate = data_acked / ack_elapsed
     ack_rate = (C.delivered - P.delivered) /
                (C.delivered_time - P.delivered_time)

4.6.1.2.2.  Compression and Aggregation

   For computing the delivery_rate, the sender prefers ack_rate, the
   rate at which packets were acknowledged, since this usually the most
   reliable metric.  However, this approach of directly using "ack_rate"
   faces a challenge when used with paths featuring aggregation,
   compression, or ACK decimation, which are prevalent [A15].  In such
   cases, ACK arrivals can temporarily make it appear as if data packets
   were delivered much faster than the bottleneck rate.  To filter out
   such implausible ack_rate samples, we consider the send rate for each
   flight of data, as follows.

4.6.1.2.3.  Send Rate

   The sender calculates the send rate, "send_rate", for a flight of
   data as follows.  Define "P.first_sent_time" as the time of the first
   send in a flight of data, and "P.sent_time" as the time the final
   send in that flight of data (the send that transmits packet "P").
   The elapsed time for sending the flight is:

     send_elapsed = (P.sent_time - P.first_sent_time)

   Then we calculate the send_rate as:

     send_rate = data_acked / send_elapsed

   Using our "delivery" curve model above, the send_rate can be viewed
   as the average slope of a "send" curve that traces the amount of data
   sent on the Y axis, and the time elapsed on the X axis: the average
   slope of the transmission of this flight of data.

4.6.1.2.4.  Delivery Rate

   Since it is physically impossible to have data delivered faster than
   it is sent in a sustained fashion, when the estimator notices that
   the ack_rate for a flight is faster than the send rate for the
   flight, it filters out the implausible ack_rate by capping the
   delivery rate sample to be no higher than the send rate.

   More precisely, over the interval between each transmission and
   corresponding ACK, the sender calculates a delivery rate sample,
   "delivery_rate", using the minimum of the rate at which packets were
   acknowledged or the rate at which they were sent:

     delivery_rate = min(send_rate, ack_rate)

   Since ack_rate and send_rate both have data_acked as a numerator,
   this can be computed more efficiently with a single division (instead
   of two), as follows:

     delivery_elapsed = max(ack_elapsed, send_elapsed)
     delivery_rate = data_acked / delivery_elapsed

4.6.1.3.  Tracking application-limited phases

   In application-limited phases the transmission rate is limited by the
   sending application rather than the congestion control algorithm.
   Modern transport protocol connections are often application-limited,
   either due to request/response workloads (e.g., Web traffic, RPC
   traffic) or because the sender transmits data in chunks (e.g.,
   adaptive streaming video).

   Knowing whether a delivery rate sample was application-limited is
   crucial for congestion control algorithms and applications to use the
   estimated delivery rate samples properly.  For example, congestion
   control algorithms likely do not want to react to a delivery rate
   that is lower simply because the sender is application-limited; for
   congestion control the key metric is the rate at which the network
   path can deliver data, and not simply the rate at which the
   application happens to be transmitting data at any moment.

   To track this, the estimator marks a bandwidth sample as application-
   limited if there was some moment during the sampled flight of data
   packets when there was no data ready to send.

   The algorithm detects that an application-limited phase has started
   when the sending application requests to send new data, or the
   connection's retransmission mechanisms decide to retransmit data, and
   the connection meets all of the following conditions:

   1.  The transport send buffer has less than one SMSS of unsent data
       available to send.

   2.  The sending flow is not currently in the process of transmitting
       a packet.

   3.  The amount of data considered in flight is less than the
       congestion window (cwnd).

   4.  All the packets considered lost have been retransmitted.

   If these conditions are all met then the sender has run out of data
   to feed the network.  This would effectively create a "bubble" of
   idle time in the data pipeline.  This idle time means that any
   delivery rate sample obtained from this data packet, and any rate
   sample from a packet that follows it in the next round trip, is going
   to be an application-limited sample that potentially underestimates
   the true available bandwidth.  Thus, when the algorithm marks a
   transport flow as application-limited, it marks all bandwidth samples
   for the next round trip as application-limited (at which point, the
   "bubble" can be said to have exited the data pipeline).

4.6.1.3.1.  Considerations Related to Receiver Flow Control Limits

   In some cases receiver flow control limits (such as the TCP [RFC9293]
   advertised receive window, RCV.WND) are the factor limiting the
   delivery rate.  This algorithm treats cases where the delivery rate
   was constrained by such conditions the same as it treats cases where
   the delivery rate is constrained by in-network bottlenecks.  That is,
   it treats receiver bottlenecks the same as network bottlenecks.  This
   has a conceptual symmetry and has worked well in practice for
   congestion control and telemetry purposes.

4.6.2.  Detailed Delivery Rate Sampling Algorithm

4.6.2.1.  Variables

4.6.2.1.1.  Per-connection (C) state

   This algorithm requires the following new state variables for each
   transport connection:

   C.delivered: The total amount of data (measured in octets or in
   packets) delivered so far over the lifetime of the transport
   connection.  This MUST NOT include pure ACK packets.  It SHOULD
   include spurious retransmissions that have been acknowledged as
   delivered.

   C.delivered_time: The wall clock time when C.delivered was last
   updated.

   C.first_sent_time: If packets are in flight, then this holds the send
   time of the packet that was most recently marked as delivered.  Else,
   if the connection was recently idle, then this holds the send time of
   most recently sent packet.

   C.app_limited: The index of the last transmitted packet marked as
   application-limited, or 0 if the connection is not currently
   application-limited.

   We also assume that the transport protocol sender implementation
   tracks the following state per connection.  If the following state
   variables are not tracked by an existing implementation, all the
   following parameters MUST be tracked to implement this algorithm:

   C.write_seq: The data sequence number one higher than that of the
   last octet queued for transmission in the transport layer write
   buffer.

   C.pending_transmissions: The number of bytes queued for transmission
   on the sending host at layers lower than the transport layer (i.e.
   network layer, traffic shaping layer, network device layer).

   C.lost_out: The number of packets in the current outstanding window
   that are marked as lost.

   C.retrans_out: The number of packets in the current outstanding
   window that are being retransmitted.

   C.pipe: The sender's estimate of the amount of data outstanding in
   the network (measured in octets or packets).  This includes data
   packets in the current outstanding window that are inflight and have
   not been acknowledged or marked lost (e.g. "pipe" from [RFC6675] or
   "bytes_in_flight" from [RFC9002]).  This MUST NOT include pure ACK
   packets.

4.6.2.1.2.  Per-packet (P) state

   This algorithm requires the following new state variables for each
   packet that has been transmitted but has not been acknowledged:

   P.delivered: C.delivered when the packet was sent from transport
   connection C.

   P.delivered_time: C.delivered_time when the packet was sent.

   P.first_sent_time: C.first_sent_time when the packet was sent.

   P.is_app_limited: true if C.app_limited was non-zero when the packet
   was sent, else false.

   P.sent_time: The time when the packet was sent.

4.6.2.1.3.  Rate Sample (rs) Output

   This algorithm provides its output in a RateSample structure rs,
   containing the following fields:

   rs.delivery_rate: The delivery rate sample (in most cases
   rs.delivered / rs.interval).

   rs.is_app_limited: The P.is_app_limited from the most recent packet
   delivered; indicates whether the rate sample is application-limited.

   rs.interval: The length of the sampling interval.

   rs.delivered: The amount of data marked as delivered over the
   sampling interval.

   rs.prior_delivered: The P.delivered count from the most recent packet
   delivered.

   rs.prior_time: The P.delivered_time from the most recent packet
   delivered.

   rs.send_elapsed: Send time interval calculated from the most recent
   packet delivered (see the "Send Rate" section above).

   rs.ack_elapsed: ACK time interval calculated from the most recent
   packet delivered (see the "ACK Rate" section above).

4.6.2.2.  Transmitting a data packet

   Upon transmitting a data packet, the sender snapshots the current
   delivery information in per-packet state.  This will allow the sender
   to generate a rate sample later, in the UpdateRateSample() step, when
   the packet is (S)ACKed.

   If there are packets already in flight, then we need to start
   delivery rate samples from the time we received the most recent ACK,
   to try to ensure that we include the full time the network needs to
   deliver all in-flight data.  If there is no data in flight yet, then
   we can start the delivery rate interval at the current time, since we
   know that any ACKs after now indicate that the network was able to
   deliver that data completely in the sampling interval between now and
   the next ACK.

   After each packet transmission, the sender executes the following
   steps:

     SendPacket(Packet P):
       if (SND.NXT == SND.UNA)  /* no packets in flight yet? */
         C.first_sent_time  = C.delivered_time = P.sent_time

       P.first_sent_time = C.first_sent_time
       P.delivered_time  = C.delivered_time
       P.delivered       = C.delivered
       P.is_app_limited  = (C.app_limited != 0)

4.6.2.3.  Upon receiving an ACK

   When an ACK arrives, the sender invokes GenerateRateSample() to fill
   in a rate sample.  For each packet that was newly acknowledged,
   UpdateRateSample() updates the rate sample based on a snapshot of
   connection delivery information from the time at which the packet was
   last transmitted.  UpdateRateSample() is invoked multiple times when
   a stretched ACK acknowledges multiple data packets.  In this case we
   use the information from the most recently sent packet, i.e., the
   packet with the highest "P.delivered" value.

     /* Upon receiving ACK, fill in delivery rate sample rs. */
     GenerateRateSample(RateSample rs):
       for each newly acknowledged packet P
         UpdateRateSample(P, rs)

       /* Clear app-limited field if bubble is ACKed and gone. */
       if (C.app_limited and C.delivered > C.app_limited)
         C.app_limited = 0

       if (rs.prior_time == 0)
         return false  /* nothing delivered on this ACK */

       /* Use the longer of the send_elapsed and ack_elapsed */
       rs.interval = max(rs.send_elapsed, rs.ack_elapsed)

       rs.delivered = C.delivered - rs.prior_delivered

       /* Normally we expect interval >= MinRTT.
        * Note that rate may still be overestimated when a spuriously
        * retransmitted skb was first (s)acked because "interval"
        * is under-estimated (up to an RTT). However, continuously
        * measuring the delivery rate during loss recovery is crucial
        * for connections that suffer heavy or prolonged losses.
        */
       if (rs.interval <  MinRTT(tp))
         rs.interval = -1
         return false  /* no reliable sample */

       if (rs.interval != 0)
         rs.delivery_rate = rs.delivered / rs.interval

       return true;  /* we filled in rs with a rate sample */

     /* Update rs when a packet is acknowledged. */
     UpdateRateSample(Packet P, RateSample rs):
       if (P.delivered_time == 0)
         return /* P already acknowledged */

       C.delivered += P.data_length
       C.delivered_time = Now()

       /* Update info using the newest packet: */
       if (!rs.has_data or IsNewestPacket(P, rs))
         rs.has_data         = true
         rs.prior_delivered  = P.delivered
         rs.prior_time       = P.delivered_time
         rs.is_app_limited   = P.is_app_limited
         rs.send_elapsed     = P.sent_time - P.first_sent_time
         rs.ack_elapsed      = C.delivered_time - P.delivered_time
         rs.last_end_seq     = P.end_seq
         C.first_sent_time   = P.sent_time

       /* Mark the packet as delivered once it's acknowleged. */
       P.delivered_time = 0

     /* Is the given Packet the most recently sent packet
      * that has been delivered? */
     IsNewestPacket(Packet P, RateSample rs):
       return (P.sent_time > C.first_sent_time or
               (P.sent_time == C.first_sent_time and
                after(P.end_seq, rs.last_end_seq))

4.6.2.4.  Detecting application-limited phases

   An application-limited phase starts when the connection decides to
   send more data, at a point in time when the connection had previously
   run out of data.  Some decisions to send more data are triggered by
   the application writing more data to the connection, and some are
   triggered by loss detection (during ACK processing or upon the
   triggering of a timer) estimating that some sequence ranges need to
   be retransmitted.  To detect all such cases, the algorithm calls
   CheckIfApplicationLimited() to check for application-limited behavior
   in the following situations:

   *  The sending application asks the transport layer to send more
      data; i.e., upon each write from the application, before new
      application data is enqueued in the transport send buffer or
      transmitted.

   *  At the beginning of ACK processing, before updating the estimated
      number of packets in flight, and before congestion control
      modifies the cwnd or pacing rate.

   *  At the beginning of connection timer processing, for all timers
      that might result in the transmission of one or more data
      segments.  For example: RTO timers, TLP timers, RACK reordering
      timers, or Zero Window Probe timers.

   When checking for application-limited behavior, the connection checks
   all the conditions previously described in the "Tracking application-
   limited phases" section, and if all are met then it marks the
   connection as application-limited:

     CheckIfApplicationLimited():
       if (C.write_seq - SND.NXT < SND.MSS and
           C.pending_transmissions == 0 and
           C.pipe < cwnd and
           C.lost_out <= C.retrans_out)
         C.app_limited = (C.delivered + C.pipe) ? : 1

4.6.3.  Delivery Rate Sampling Discussion

4.6.3.1.  Offload Mechanisms

   If a transport sender implementation uses an offload mechanism (such
   as TSO, GSO, etc.) to combine multiple SMSS of data into a single
   packet "aggregate" for the purposes of scheduling transmissions, then
   it is RECOMMENDED that the per-packet state be tracked for each
   packet "aggregate" rather than each SMSS.  For simplicity this
   document refers to such state as "per-packet", whether it is per
   "aggregate" or per SMSS.

4.6.3.2.  Impact of ACK losses

   Delivery rate samples are generated upon receiving each ACK; ACKs may
   contain both cumulative and selective acknowledgment information.
   Losing an ACK results in losing the delivery rate sample
   corresponding to that ACK, and generating a delivery rate sample at
   later a time (upon the arrival of the next ACK).  This can
   underestimate the delivery rate due the artificially inflated
   "rs.interval".  The impact of this effect is mitigated using the
   BBR.max_bw filter.

4.6.3.3.  Impact of packet reordering

   This algorithm is robust to packet reordering; it makes no
   assumptions about the order in which packets are delivered or ACKed.
   In particular, for a particular packet P, it does not matter which
   packets are delivered between the transmission of P and the ACK of
   packet P, since C.delivered will be incremented appropriately in any
   case.

4.6.3.4.  Impact of packet loss and retransmissions

   There are several possible approaches for handling cases where a
   delivery rate sample is based on a retransmitted packet.

   If the transport protocol supports unambiguous ACKs for retransmitted
   data (as in QUIC [RFC9000]) then the algorithm is perfectly robust to
   retransmissions, because the starting packet, P, for the sample can
   be unambiguously retrieved.

   If the transport protocol, like TCP [RFC9293], has ambiguous ACKs for
   retransmitted sequence ranges, then the following approaches MAY be
   used:

   1.  The sender MAY choose to filter out implausible delivery rate
       samples, as described in the GenerateRateSample() step in the
       "Upon receiving an ACK" section, by discarding samples whose
       rs.interval is lower than the minimum RTT seen on the connection.

   2.  The sender MAY choose to skip the generation of a delivery rate
       sample for a retransmitted sequence range.

4.6.3.4.1.  TCP Connections without SACK

   Whenever possibile, TCP connections using BBR as a congestion
   controller SHOULD use both SACK and timestamps.  Failure to do so
   will cause BBR's RTT and bandwidth measurements to be much less
   accurate.

   When using TCP without SACK (i.e., either or both ends of the
   connections do not accept SACK), this algorithm can be extended to
   estimate approximate delivery rates using duplicate ACKs (much like
   Reno and [RFC5681] estimates that each duplicate ACK indicates that a
   data packet has been delivered).

4.6.4.  BBR.max_bw Max Filter

   Delivery rate samples are often below the typical bottleneck
   bandwidth available to the flow, due to "noise" introduced by random
   variation in physical transmission processes (e.g. radio link layer
   noise) or queues or along the network path.  To filter these effects
   BBR uses a max filter: BBR estimates BBR.max_bw using the windowed
   maximum recent delivery rate sample seen by the connection over
   recent history.

   The BBR.max_bw max filter window covers a time period extending over
   the past two ProbeBW cycles.  The BBR.max_bw max filter window length
   is driven by trade-offs among several considerations:

   *  It is long enough to cover at least one entire ProbeBW cycle (see
      the "ProbeBW" section).  This ensures that the window contains at
      least some delivery rate samples that are the result of data
      transmitted with a super-unity pacing_gain (a pacing_gain larger
      than 1.0).  Such super-unity delivery rate samples are
      instrumental in revealing the path's underlying available
      bandwidth even when there is noise from delivery rate shortfalls
      due to aggregation delays, queuing delays from variable cross-
      traffic, lossy link layers with uncorrected losses, or short-term
      buffer exhaustion (e.g., brief coincident bursts in a shallow
      buffer).

   *  It aims to be long enough to cover short-term fluctuations in the
      network's delivery rate due to the aforementioned sources of
      noise.  In particular, the delivery rate for radio link layers
      (e.g., wifi and cellular technologies) can be highly variable, and
      the filter window needs to be long enough to remember "good"
      delivery rate samples in order to be robust to such variations.

   *  It aims to be short enough to respond in a timely manner to
      sustained reductions in the bandwidth available to a flow, whether
      this is because other flows are using a larger share of the
      bottleneck, or the bottleneck link service rate has reduced due to
      layer 1 or layer 2 changes, policy changes, or routing changes.
      In any of these cases, existing BBR flows traversing the
      bottleneck should, in a timely manner, reduce their BBR.max_bw
      estimates and thus pacing rate and in-flight data, in order to
      match the sending behavior to the new available bandwidth.

4.6.5.  BBR.max_bw and Application-limited Delivery Rate Samples

   Transmissions can be application-limited, meaning the transmission
   rate is limited by the application rather than the congestion control
   algorithm.  This is quite common because of request/response traffic.
   When there is a transmission opportunity but no data to send, the
   delivery rate sampler marks the corresponding bandwidth sample(s) as
   application-limited Section 4.6.  The BBR.max_bw estimator carefully
   decides which samples to include in the bandwidth model to ensure
   that BBR.max_bw reflects network limits, not application limits.  By
   default, the estimator discards application-limited samples, since by
   definition they reflect application limits.  However, the estimator
   does use application-limited samples if the measured delivery rate
   happens to be larger than the current BBR.max_bw estimate, since this
   indicates the current BBR.Max_bw estimate is too low.

4.6.6.  Updating the BBR.max_bw Max Filter

   For every ACK that acknowledges some data packets as delivered, BBR
   invokes BBRUpdateMaxBw() to update the BBR.max_bw estimator as
   follows (here rs.delivery_rate is the delivery rate sample obtained
   from the ACK that is being processed, as specified in Section 4.6):

     BBRUpdateMaxBw()
       BBRUpdateRound()
       if (rs.delivery_rate >= BBR.max_bw || !rs.is_app_limited)
           BBR.max_bw = UpdateWindowedMaxFilter(
                         filter=BBR.MaxBwFilter,
                         value=rs.delivery_rate,
                         time=BBR.cycle_count,
                         window_length=MaxBwFilterLen)

4.6.7.  Tracking Time for the BBR.max_bw Max Filter

   BBR tracks time for the BBR.max_bw filter window using a virtual
   (non-wall-clock) time tracked by counting the cyclical progression
   through ProbeBW cycles.  Each time through the Probe bw cycle, one
   round trip after exiting ProbeBW_UP (the point at which the flow has
   its best chance to measure the highest throughput of the cycle), BBR
   increments BBR.cycle_count, the virtual time used by the BBR.max_bw
   filter window.  Note that BBR.cycle_count only needs to be tracked
   with a single bit, since the BBR.max_bw filter only needs to track
   samples from two time slots: the previous ProbeBW cycle and the
   current ProbeBW cycle:

     BBRAdvanceMaxBwFilter():
       BBR.cycle_count++

4.6.8.  BBR.min_rtt: Estimated Minimum Round-Trip Time

   BBR.min_rtt is BBR's estimate of the round-trip propagation delay of
   the path over which a transport connection is sending.  The path's
   round-trip propagation delay determines the minimum amount of time
   over which the connection must be willing to sustain transmissions at
   the BBR.bw rate, and thus the minimum amount of data needed in
   flight, for the connection to reach full utilization (a "Full Pipe").
   The round-trip propagation delay can vary over the life of a
   connection, so BBR continually estimates BBR.min_rtt using recent
   round-trip delay samples.

4.6.8.1.  Round-Trip Time Samples for Estimating BBR.min_rtt

   For every data packet a connection sends, BBR calculates an RTT
   sample that measures the time interval from sending a data packet
   until that packet is acknowledged.

   The only divergence from RTT estimation for retransmission timeouts
   is in the case where a given acknowledgment ACKs more than one data
   packet.  In order to be conservative and schedule long timeouts to
   avoid spurious retransmissions, the maximum among such potential RTT
   samples is typically used for computing retransmission timeouts;
   i.e., SRTT is typically calculated using the data packet with the
   earliest transmission time.  By contrast, in order for BBR to try to
   reach the minimum amount of data in flight to fill the pipe, BBR uses
   the minimum among such potential RTT samples; i.e., BBR calculates
   the RTT using the data packet with the latest transmission time.

4.6.8.2.  BBR.min_rtt Min Filter

   RTT samples tend to be above the round-trip propagation delay of the
   path, due to "noise" introduced by random variation in physical
   transmission processes (e.g. radio link layer noise), queues along
   the network path, the receiver's delayed ack strategy, ack
   aggregation, etc.  Thus to filter out these effects BBR uses a min
   filter: BBR estimates BBR.min_rtt using the minimum recent RTT sample
   seen by the connection over that past MinRTTFilterLen seconds.  (Many
   of the same network effects that can decrease delivery rate
   measurements can increase RTT samples, which is why BBR's min-
   filtering approach for RTTs is the complement of its max-filtering
   approach for delivery rates.)

   The length of the BBR.min_rtt min filter window is MinRTTFilterLen =
   10 secs.  This is driven by trade-offs among several considerations:

   *  The MinRTTFilterLen is longer than ProbeRTTInterval, so that it
      covers an entire ProbeRTT cycle (see the "ProbeRTT" section
      below).  This helps ensure that the window can contain RTT samples
      that are the result of data transmitted with inflight below the
      estimated BDP of the flow.  Such RTT samples are important for
      helping to reveal the path's underlying two-way propagation delay
      even when the aforementioned "noise" effects can often obscure it.

   *  The MinRTTFilterLen aims to be long enough to avoid needing to
      reduce in-flight data and throughput often.  Measuring two-way
      propagation delay requires in-flight data to be at or below the
      BDP, which risks some amount of underutilization, so BBR uses a
      filter window long enough that such underutilization events can be
      rare.

   *  The MinRTTFilterLen aims to be long enough that many applications
      have a "natural" moment of silence or low utilization that can
      reduce in-flight data below the BDP and naturally serve to refresh
      the BBR.min_rtt, without requiring BBR to force an artificial
      reduction in in-flight data.  This applies to many popular
      applications, including Web, RPC, or chunked audio/video traffic.

   *  The MinRTTFilterLen aims to be short enough to respond in a timely
      manner to real increases in the two-way propagation delay of the
      path, e.g. due to route changes, which are expected to typically
      happen on longer time scales.

   A BBR implementation MAY use a generic windowed min filter to track
   BBR.min_rtt.  However, a significant savings in space and improvement
   in freshness can be achieved by integrating the BBR.min_rtt
   estimation into the ProbeRTT state machine, so this document
   discusses that approach in the ProbeRTT section.

4.6.9.  BBR.offload_budget

   BBR.offload_budget is the estimate of the minimum volume of data
   necessary to achieve full throughput using sender (TSO/GSO) and
   receiver (LRO, GRO) host offload mechanisms.  This varies based on
   the transport protocol and operating environment.

   For TCP, offload_budget can be computed as follows:

       BBRUpdateOffloadBudget():
         BBR.offload_budget = 3 * BBR.send_quantum

   The factor of 3 is chosen to allow maintaining at least:

   *  1 quantum in the sending host's queuing discipline layer

   *  1 quantum being segmented in the sending host TSO/GSO engine

   *  1 quantum being reassembled or otherwise remaining unacknowledged
      due to the receiver host's LRO/GRO/delayed-ACK engine

4.6.10.  BBR.extra_acked

   BBR.extra_acked is a volume of data that is the estimate of the
   recent degree of aggregation in the network path.  For each ACK, the
   algorithm computes a sample of the estimated extra ACKed data beyond
   the amount of data that the sender expected to be ACKed over the
   timescale of a round-trip, given the BBR.bw.  Then it computes
   BBR.extra_acked as the windowed maximum sample over the last
   BBRExtraAckedFilterLen=10 packet-timed round-trips.  If the ACK rate
   falls below the expected bandwidth, then the algorithm estimates an
   aggregation episode has terminated, and resets the sampling interval
   to start from the current time.

   The BBR.extra_acked thus reflects the recently-measured magnitude of
   data and ACK aggregation effects such as batching and slotting at
   shared-medium L2 hops (wifi, cellular, DOCSIS), as well as end-host
   offload mechanisms (TSO, GSO, LRO, GRO), and end host or middlebox
   ACK decimation/thinning.

   BBR augments its cwnd by BBR.extra_acked to allow the connection to
   keep sending during inter-ACK silences, to an extent that matches the
   recently measured degree of aggregation.

   More precisely, this is computed as:

     BBRUpdateACKAggregation():
       /* Find excess ACKed beyond expected amount over this interval */
       interval = (Now() - BBR.extra_acked_interval_start)
       expected_delivered = BBR.bw * interval
       /* Reset interval if ACK rate is below expected rate: */
       if (BBR.extra_acked_delivered <= expected_delivered)
           BBR.extra_acked_delivered = 0
           BBR.extra_acked_interval_start = Now()
           expected_delivered = 0
       BBR.extra_acked_delivered += rs.newly_acked
       extra = BBR.extra_acked_delivered - expected_delivered
       extra = min(extra, cwnd)
       if (BBR.full_bw_reached)
         filter_len = BBRExtraAckedFilterLen
       else
         filter_len = 1  /* in Startup, just remember 1 round */
       BBR.extra_acked =
         UpdateWindowedMaxFilter(
           filter=BBR.ExtraACKedFilter,
           value=extra,
           time=BBR.round_count,
           window_length=filter_len)

4.6.11.  Updating the Model Upon Packet Loss

   In every state, BBR responds to (filtered) congestion signals,
   including loss.  The response to those congestion signals depends on
   the flow's current state, since the information that the flow can
   infer depends on what the flow was doing when the flow experienced
   the signal.

4.6.11.1.  Probing for Bandwidth In Startup

   In Startup, if the congestion signals meet the Startup exit criteria,
   the flow exits Startup and enters Drain (see Section 4.3.1.3).

4.6.11.2.  Probing for Bandwidth In ProbeBW

   BBR searches for the maximum volume of data that can be sensibly
   placed in flight in the network.  A key precondition is that the flow
   is actually trying robustly to find that operating point.  To
   implement this, when a flow is in ProbeBW, and an ACK covers data
   sent in one of the accelerating phases (REFILL or UP), and the ACK
   indicates that the loss rate over the past round trip exceeds the
   queue pressure objective, and the flow is not application limited,
   and has not yet responded to congestion signals from the most recent
   REFILL or UP phase, then the flow estimates that the volume of data
   it allowed in flight exceeded what matches the current delivery
   process on the path, and reduces BBR.inflight_longterm:

     /* Do loss signals suggest inflight is too high? */
     IsInflightTooHigh():
       return (rs.lost > rs.tx_in_flight * BBRLossThresh)

     BBRHandleInflightTooHigh():
       BBR.bw_probe_samples = 0;  /* only react once per bw probe */
       if (!rs.is_app_limited)
         BBR.inflight_longterm = max(rs.tx_in_flight,
                               BBRTargetInflight() * BBRBeta))
       If (BBR.state == ProbeBW_UP)
         BBRStartProbeBW_DOWN()

   Here rs.tx_in_flight is the amount of data that was estimated to be
   in flight when the most recently ACKed packet was sent.  And the
   BBRBeta (0.7x) bound is to try to ensure that BBR does not react more
   dramatically than CUBIC's 0.7x multiplicative decrease factor.

   Some loss detection algorithms, including RACK [RFC8985] or QUIC loss
   detection [RFC9002], delay loss marking to wait for potential
   reordering, so packets can be declared lost long after the loss
   itself. happened.  In such cases, the tx_in_flight for the delivered
   sequence range that allowed the loss to be detected may be
   considerably smaller than the tx_in_flight of the lost packet itself.
   In such cases using the former tx_in_flight rather than the latter
   can cause BBR.inflight_longterm to be significantly underestimated.
   To avoid such issues, BBR processes each loss detection event to more
   precisely estimate the volume of in-flight data at which loss rates
   cross BBRLossThresh, noting that this may have happened mid-way
   through some TSO/GSO offload burst (represented as a "packet" in the
   pseudocode in this document).  To estimate this threshold volume of
   data, we can solve for "lost_prefix" in the following way, where
   inflight_prev represents the volume of in-flight data preceding this
   packet, and lost_prev represents the data lost among that previous
   in-flight data.

   First we start with:

     lost / inflight >= BBRLossThresh

   Expanding this, we get:

     (lost_prev + lost_prefix) /    >= BBRLossThresh
     (inflight_prev + lost_prefix)

   Solving for lost_prefix, we arrive at:

     lost_prefix >= (BBRLossThresh * inflight_prev - lost_prev) /
                       (1 - BBRLossThresh)

   In pseudocode:

     BBRNoteLoss()
       if (!BBR.loss_in_round)   /* first loss in this round trip? */
         BBR.loss_round_delivered = C.delivered
       BBR.loss_in_round = 1

     BBRHandleLostPacket(packet):
       BBRNoteLoss()
       if (!BBR.bw_probe_samples)
         return /* not a packet sent while probing bandwidth */
       rs.tx_in_flight = packet.tx_in_flight /* inflight at transmit */
       rs.lost = C.lost - packet.lost /* data lost since transmit */
       rs.is_app_limited = packet.is_app_limited;
       if (IsInflightTooHigh())
         rs.tx_in_flight = BBRInflightLongtermFromLostPacket(rs, packet)
         BBRHandleInflightTooHigh()

     /* At what prefix of packet did losses exceed BBRLossThresh? */
     BBRInflightLongtermFromLostPacket(rs, packet):
       size = packet.size
       /* What was in flight before this packet? */
       inflight_prev = rs.tx_in_flight - size
       /* What was lost before this packet? */
       lost_prev = rs.lost - size
       lost_prefix = (BBRLossThresh * inflight_prev - lost_prev) /
                     (1 - BBRLossThresh)
       /* At what inflight value did losses cross BBRLossThresh? */
       inflight = inflight_prev + lost_prefix
       return inflight

4.6.11.3.  When not Probing for Bandwidth

   When not explicitly accelerating to probe for bandwidth (Drain,
   ProbeRTT, ProbeBW_DOWN, ProbeBW_CRUISE), BBR responds to loss by
   slowing down to some extent.  This is because loss suggests that the
   available bandwidth and safe volume of in-flight data may have
   decreased recently, and the flow needs to adapt, slowing down toward
   the latest delivery process.  BBR flows implement this response by
   reducing the short-term model parameters, BBR.bw_shortterm and
   BBR.inflight_shortterm.

   When encountering packet loss when the flow is not probing for
   bandwidth, the strategy is to gradually adapt to the current measured
   delivery process (the rate and volume of data that is delivered
   through the network path over the last round trip).  This applies
   generally: whether in fast recovery, RTO recovery, TLP recovery;
   whether application-limited or not.

   There are two key parameters the algorithm tracks, to measure the
   current delivery process:

   BBR.bw_latest: a 1-round-trip max of delivered bandwidth
   (rs.delivery_rate).

   BBR.inflight_latest: a 1-round-trip max of delivered volume of data
   (rs.delivered).

   Upon the ACK at the end of each round that encountered a newly-marked
   loss, the flow updates its model (bw_shortterm and
   inflight_shortterm) as follows:

      bw_shortterm = max(       bw_latest, BBRBeta *       bw_shortterm )
inflight_shortterm = max( inflight_latest, BBRBeta * inflight_shortterm )

   This logic can be represented as follows:

     /* Near start of ACK processing: */
     BBRUpdateLatestDeliverySignals():
       BBR.loss_round_start = 0
       BBR.bw_latest       = max(BBR.bw_latest,       rs.delivery_rate)
       BBR.inflight_latest = max(BBR.inflight_latest, rs.delivered)
       if (rs.prior_delivered >= BBR.loss_round_delivered)
         BBR.loss_round_delivered = C.delivered
         BBR.loss_round_start = 1

     /* Near end of ACK processing: */
     BBRAdvanceLatestDeliverySignals():
       if (BBR.loss_round_start)
         BBR.bw_latest       = rs.delivery_rate

4.7.  Updating Control Parameters

   BBR uses three distinct but interrelated control parameters: pacing
   rate, send quantum, and congestion window (cwnd).

4.7.1.  Summary of Control Behavior in the State Machine

   The following table summarizes how BBR modulates the control
   parameters in each state.  In the table below, the semantics of the
   columns are as follows:

   *  State: the state in the BBR state machine, as depicted in the
      "State Transition Diagram" section above.

   *  Tactic: The tactic chosen from the "State Machine Tactics" in
      Section 4.1.3: "accel" refers to acceleration, "decel" to
      deceleration, and "cruise" to cruising.

   *  Pacing Gain: the value used for BBR.pacing_gain in the given
      state.

   *  Cwnd Gain: the value used for BBR.cwnd_gain in the given state.

   *  Rate Cap: the rate values applied as bounds on the BBR.max_bw
      value applied to compute BBR.bw.

   *  Volume Cap: the volume values applied as bounds on the
      BBR.max_inflight value to compute cwnd.

   The control behavior can be summarized as follows.  Upon processing
   each ACK, BBR uses the values in the table below to compute BBR.bw in
   BBRBoundBWForModel(), and the cwnd in BBRBoundCwndForModel():

---------------+--------+--------+------+--------------+-----------------

4.7.2.  Pacing Rate: BBR.pacing_rate

   To help match the packet-arrival rate to the bottleneck bandwidth
   available to the flow, BBR paces data packets.  Pacing enforces a
   maximum rate at which BBR schedules quanta of packets for
   transmission.

   The sending host implements pacing by maintaining inter-quantum
   spacing at the time each packet is scheduled for departure,
   calculating the next departure time for a packet for a given flow
   (BBR.next_departure_time) as a function of the most recent packet
   size and the current pacing rate, as follows:

     BBR.next_departure_time = max(Now(), BBR.next_departure_time)
     packet.departure_time = BBR.next_departure_time
     pacing_delay = packet.size / BBR.pacing_rate
     BBR.next_departure_time = BBR.next_departure_time + pacing_delay

   To adapt to the bottleneck, in general BBR sets the pacing rate to be
   proportional to bw, with a dynamic gain, or scaling factor of
   proportionality, called pacing_gain.

   When a BBR flow starts it has no bw estimate (bw is 0).  So in this
   case it sets an initial pacing rate based on the transport sender
   implementation's initial congestion window ("InitialCwnd", e.g. from
   [RFC6928]), the initial SRTT (smoothed round-trip time) after the
   first non-zero RTT sample, and the initial pacing_gain:

     BBRInitPacingRate():
       nominal_bandwidth = InitialCwnd / (SRTT ? SRTT : 1ms)
       BBR.pacing_rate =  BBRStartupPacingGain * nominal_bandwidth

   After initialization, on each data ACK BBR updates its pacing rate to
   be proportional to bw, as long as it estimates that it has filled the
   pipe (BBR.full_bw_reached is true; see the "Startup" section for
   details), or doing so increases the pacing rate.  Limiting the pacing
   rate updates in this way helps the connection probe robustly for
   bandwidth until it estimates it has reached its full available
   bandwidth ("filled the pipe").  In particular, this prevents the
   pacing rate from being reduced when the connection has only seen
   application-limited bandwidth samples.  BBR updates the pacing rate
   on each ACK by executing the BBRSetPacingRate() step as follows:

     BBRSetPacingRateWithGain(pacing_gain):
       rate = pacing_gain * bw * (100 - BBRPacingMarginPercent) / 100
       if (BBR.full_bw_reached || rate > BBR.pacing_rate)
         BBR.pacing_rate = rate

     BBRSetPacingRate():
       BBRSetPacingRateWithGain(BBR.pacing_gain)

   To help drive the network toward lower queues and low latency while
   maintaining high utilization, the BBRPacingMarginPercent constant of
   1 aims to cause BBR to pace at 1% below the bw, on average.

4.7.3.  Send Quantum: BBR.send_quantum

   In order to amortize per-packet overheads involved in the sending
   process (host CPU, NIC processing, and interrupt processing delays),
   high-performance transport sender implementations (e.g., Linux TCP)
   often schedule an aggregate containing multiple packets (multiple
   SMSS) worth of data as a single quantum (using TSO, GSO, or other
   offload mechanisms).  The BBR congestion control algorithm makes this
   control decision explicitly, dynamically calculating a quantum
   control parameter that specifies the maximum size of these
   transmission aggregates.  This decision is based on a trade-off:

   *  A smaller quantum is preferred at lower data rates because it
      results in shorter packet bursts, shorter queues, lower queueing
      delays, and lower rates of packet loss.

   *  A bigger quantum can be required at higher data rates because it
      results in lower CPU overheads at the sending and receiving hosts,
      who can ship larger amounts of data with a single trip through the
      networking stack.

   On each ACK, BBR runs BBRSetSendQuantum() to update BBR.send_quantum
   as follows:

     BBRSetSendQuantum():
       BBR.send_quantum = BBR.pacing_rate * 1ms
       BBR.send_quantum = min(BBR.send_quantum, 64 KBytes)
       BBR.send_quantum = max(BBR.send_quantum, 2 * SMSS)

   A BBR implementation MAY use alternate approaches to select a
   BBR.send_quantum, as appropriate for the CPU overheads anticipated
   for senders and receivers, and buffering considerations anticipated
   in the network path.  However, for the sake of the network and other
   users, a BBR implementation SHOULD attempt to use the smallest
   feasible quanta.

4.7.4.  Congestion Window

   The congestion window, or cwnd, controls the maximum volume of data
   BBR allows in flight in the network at any time.  It is the maximum
   volume of in-flight data that the algorithm estimates is appropriate
   for matching the current network path delivery process, given all
   available signals in the model, at any time scale.  BBR adapts the
   cwnd based on its model of the network path and the state machine's
   decisions about how to probe that path.

   By default, BBR grows its cwnd to meet its BBR.max_inflight, which
   models what's required for achieving full throughput, and as such is
   scaled to adapt to the estimated BDP computed from its path model.
   But BBR's selection of cwnd is designed to explicitly trade off among
   competing considerations that dynamically adapt to various
   conditions.  So in loss recovery BBR more conservatively adjusts its
   sending behavior based on more recent delivery samples, and if BBR
   needs to re-probe the current BBR.min_rtt of the path then it cuts
   its cwnd accordingly.  The following sections describe the various
   considerations that impact cwnd.

4.7.4.1.  Initial cwnd

   BBR generally uses measurements to build a model of the network path
   and then adapts control decisions to the path based on that model.
   As such, the selection of the initial cwnd is considered to be
   outside the scope of the BBR algorithm, since at initialization there
   are no measurements yet upon which BBR can operate.  Thus, at
   initialization, BBR uses the transport sender implementation's
   initial congestion window (e.g. from [RFC6298] for TCP).

4.7.4.2.  Computing BBR.max_inflight

   The BBR BBR.max_inflight is the upper bound on the volume of data BBR
   allows in flight.  This bound is always in place, and dominates when
   all other considerations have been satisfied: the flow is not in loss
   recovery, does not need to probe BBR.min_rtt, and has accumulated
   confidence in its model parameters by receiving enough ACKs to
   gradually grow the current cwnd to meet the BBR.max_inflight.

   On each ACK, BBR calculates the BBR.max_inflight in
   BBRUpdateMaxInflight() as follows:

     BBRBDPMultiple(gain):
       if (BBR.min_rtt == Infinity)
         return InitialCwnd /* no valid RTT samples yet */
       BBR.bdp = BBR.bw * BBR.min_rtt
       return gain * BBR.bdp

     BBRQuantizationBudget(inflight)
       BBRUpdateOffloadBudget()
       inflight = max(inflight, BBR.offload_budget)
       inflight = max(inflight, BBRMinPipeCwnd)
         if (BBR.state == ProbeBW_UP)
         inflight += 2*SMSS
       return inflight

     BBRInflight(gain):
       inflight = BBRBDPMultiple(gain)
       return BBRQuantizationBudget(inflight)

     BBRUpdateMaxInflight():
       inflight = BBRBDPMultiple(BBR.cwnd_gain)
       inflight += BBR.extra_acked
       BBR.max_inflight = BBRQuantizationBudget(inflight)

   The "estimated_bdp" term tries to allow enough packets in flight to
   fully utilize the estimated BDP of the path, by allowing the flow to
   send at BBR.bw for a duration of BBR.min_rtt.  Scaling up the BDP by
   BBR.cwnd_gain bounds in-flight data to a small multiple of the BDP,
   to handle common network and receiver behavior, such as delayed,
   stretched, or aggregated ACKs [A15].  The "quanta" term allows enough
   quanta in flight on the sending and receiving hosts to reach high
   throughput even in environments using offload mechanisms.

4.7.4.3.  Minimum cwnd for Pipelining

   For BBR.max_inflight, BBR imposes a floor of BBRMinPipeCwnd (4
   packets, i.e. 4 * SMSS).  This floor helps ensure that even at very
   low BDPs, and with a transport like TCP where a receiver may ACK only
   every alternate SMSS of data, there are enough packets in flight to
   maintain full pipelining.  In particular BBR tries to allow at least
   2 data packets in flight and ACKs for at least 2 data packets on the
   path from receiver to sender.

4.7.4.4.  Modulating cwnd in Loss Recovery

   BBR interprets loss as a hint that there may be recent changes in
   path behavior that are not yet fully reflected in its model of the
   path, and thus it needs to be more conservative.

   Upon a retransmission timeout (RTO), BBR conservatively reduces cwnd
   to a value that will allow 1 SMSS to be transmitted.  Then BBR
   gradually increases cwnd using the normal approach outlined below in
   "cwnd Adjustment Mechanism" in Section 4.7.4.6.

   When a BBR sender is in Fast Recovery it uses the response described
   in "Updating the Model Upon Packet Loss" in Section 4.6.11.

   When BBR exits loss recovery it restores the cwnd to the "last known
   good" value that cwnd held before entering recovery.  This applies
   equally whether the flow exits loss recovery because it finishes
   repairing all losses or because it executes an "undo" event after
   inferring that a loss recovery event was spurious.

   The high-level design for updating cwnd in loss recovery is as
   follows:

   Upon retransmission timeout (RTO):

     BBROnEnterRTO():
       BBRSaveCwnd()
       cwnd = C.pipe + 1

   Upon entering Fast Recovery:

     BBROnEnterFastRecovery():
       BBRSaveCwnd()

   Upon exiting loss recovery (RTO recovery or Fast Recovery), either by
   repairing all losses or undoing recovery, BBR restores the best-known
   cwnd value we had upon entering loss recovery:

     BBRRestoreCwnd()

   Note that exiting loss recovery happens during ACK processing, and at
   the end of ACK processing BBRBoundCwndForModel() will bound the cwnd
   based on the current model parameters.  Thus the cwnd and pacing rate
   after loss recovery will generally be smaller than the values
   entering loss recovery.

   The BBRSaveCwnd() and BBRRestoreCwnd() helpers help remember and
   restore the last-known good cwnd (the latest cwnd unmodulated by loss
   recovery or ProbeRTT), and is defined as follows:

     BBRSaveCwnd():
       if (!InLossRecovery() and BBR.state != ProbeRTT)
         BBR.prior_cwnd = cwnd
       else
         BBR.prior_cwnd = max(BBR.prior_cwnd, cwnd)

     BBRRestoreCwnd():
       cwnd = max(cwnd, BBR.prior_cwnd)

4.7.4.5.  Modulating cwnd in ProbeRTT

   If BBR decides it needs to enter the ProbeRTT state (see the
   "ProbeRTT" section below), its goal is to quickly reduce the volume
   of in-flight data and drain the bottleneck queue, thereby allowing
   measurement of BBR.min_rtt.  To implement this mode, BBR bounds the
   cwnd to BBRMinPipeCwnd, the minimal value that allows pipelining (see
   the "Minimum cwnd for Pipelining" section, above):

     BBRProbeRTTCwnd():
       probe_rtt_cwnd = BBRBDPMultiple(BBR.bw, BBRProbeRTTCwndGain)
       probe_rtt_cwnd = max(probe_rtt_cwnd, BBRMinPipeCwnd)
       return probe_rtt_cwnd

     BBRBoundCwndForProbeRTT():
       if (BBR.state == ProbeRTT)
         cwnd = min(cwnd, BBRProbeRTTCwnd())

4.7.4.6.  cwnd Adjustment Mechanism

   The network path and traffic traveling over it can make sudden
   dramatic changes.  To adapt to these changes smoothly and robustly,
   and reduce packet losses in such cases, BBR uses a conservative
   strategy.  When cwnd is above the BBR.max_inflight derived from BBR's
   path model, BBR cuts the cwnd immediately to the BBR.max_inflight.
   When cwnd is below BBR.max_inflight, BBR raises the cwnd gradually
   and cautiously, increasing cwnd by no more than the amount of data
   acknowledged (cumulatively or selectively) upon each ACK.

   Specifically, on each ACK that acknowledges "rs.newly_acked" packets
   as newly acknowledged, BBR runs the following BBRSetCwnd() steps to
   update cwnd:

     BBRSetCwnd():
       BBRUpdateMaxInflight()
       if (BBR.full_bw_reached)
         cwnd = min(cwnd + rs.newly_acked, BBR.max_inflight)
       else if (cwnd < BBR.max_inflight || C.delivered < InitialCwnd)
         cwnd = cwnd + rs.newly_acked
       cwnd = max(cwnd, BBRMinPipeCwnd)
       BBRBoundCwndForProbeRTT()
       BBRBoundCwndForModel()

   There are several considerations embodied in the logic above.  If BBR
   has measured enough samples to achieve confidence that it has filled
   the pipe (see the description of BBR.full_bw_reached in the "Startup"
   section below), then it increases its cwnd based on the number of
   packets delivered, while bounding its cwnd to be no larger than the
   BBR.max_inflight adapted to the estimated BDP.  Otherwise, if the
   cwnd is below the BBR.max_inflight, or the sender has marked so
   little data delivered (less than InitialCwnd) that it does not yet
   judge its BBR.max_bw estimate and BBR.max_inflight as useful, then it
   increases cwnd without bounding it to be below BBR.max_inflight.
   Finally, BBR imposes a floor of BBRMinPipeCwnd in order to allow
   pipelining even with small BDPs (see the "Minimum cwnd for
   Pipelining" section, above).

4.7.4.7.  Bounding cwnd Based on Recent Congestion

   Finally, BBR bounds the cwnd based on recent congestion, as outlined
   in the "Volume Cap" column of the table in the "Summary of Control
   Behavior in the State Machine" section:

     BBRBoundCwndForModel():
       cap = Infinity
       if (IsInAProbeBWState() and
           BBR.state != ProbeBW_CRUISE)
         cap = BBR.inflight_longterm
       else if (BBR.state == ProbeRTT or
                BBR.state == ProbeBW_CRUISE)
         cap = BBRInflightWithHeadroom()

       /* apply inflight_shortterm (possibly infinite): */
       cap = min(cap, BBR.inflight_shortterm)
       cap = max(cap, BBRMinPipeCwnd)
       cwnd = min(cwnd, cap)

5.  Implementation Status

   [RFC7942].  The description of implementations in this section is
   intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
   drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual
   implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
   Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
   presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not
   intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
   implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that
   other implementations may exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as

6.  Security Considerations

   This proposal makes no changes to the underlying security of
   transport protocols or congestion control algorithms.  BBR shares the
   same security considerations as the existing standard congestion
   control algorithm [RFC5681].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.  Here we are using that phrase,
   suggested by [RFC8126], because BBR does not modify or extend the
   wire format of any network protocol, nor does it add new dependencies
   on assigned numbers.  BBR involves only a change to the congestion
   control algorithm of a transport sender, and does not involve changes
   in the network, the receiver, or any network protocol.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

8.  Acknowledgments

   The authors are grateful to Len Kleinrock for his work on the theory
   underlying congestion control.  We are indebted to Larry Brakmo for
   pioneering work on the Vegas [BP95] and New Vegas [B15] congestion
   control algorithms, which presaged many elements of BBR, and for
