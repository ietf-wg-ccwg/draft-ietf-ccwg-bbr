The effect of a CE mark will be:\r\n\r\n- to terminate any bandwidth probe that BBR is carrying out, and\r\n- to pay more immediate attention to the \"delivery model\", which BBR uses to estimate the path characteristics, in adjusting the send rate and in-flight data volume for the immediate future.\r\n\r\nThis should be very easy to implement, and could also be one of the more straightforward possible modifications of BBR to test.",

          "body": "I'm pretty sure that from first principles we do need inflight_lo or something equivalent, like reducing cwnd directly.\n\nOne way to sketch the argument goes like this:\n\nWhen the bandwidth available to a flow is reduced (e.g., due to more flows competing at the bottleneck or a reduced bottleneck link rate due to radio issues) then this reduces not just the bandwidth available to a flow but also the flow's fair share of the path BDP and bottleneck buffer slots.\n\nThus, to avoid excess queuing and loss, the flow needs to reduce its pacing rate so that matches the lower available bandwidth, and reduce its congestion window to match the lower share of the path BDP and bottleneck buffer slots.\n\nOne might think that it's sufficient to reduce the pacing rate in such cases and leave cwnd unadjusted. But it's very common for ACKs to be delayed in returning to the data sender, due to various aggregation effects (e.g., ACKs waiting for their turn on a wifi network). In such cases, if the flow keeps sending at a reasoanble pacing rate but an unadjusted cwnd, then the extra packets in flight can cause excessive queuing and loss.\n\nIf folks have simulation tests, lab tests, or production data showing that good results are achievable w/o inflight_lo (inflight_shortterm) or equivalent, I'd be interested to hear about this. The tests would need to include cases with multiple BBR flows competing, and BBR flows competing with CUBIC flows, and dynamic numbers of flows competing, to make sure we've examined all the angles.\n\nOr if folks would prefer to go with reducing cwnd directly rather than having a separate inflight_lo/inflight_shortterm, let's discuss that.\n",

The text suggests detecting a \"bubble\" during which the application fails to send data.\n\nPacing is going to interfere with this detection. If pacing is implemented via some kind of \"leaky bucket\" algorithm, the first effect of the \"bubble\" is to increase the number of tokens available, up to the \"quantum\" value. As long as the available tokens do not exceed the quantum, the transport does not really know whether the opportunity to send is lost, or whether the application is going to send a batch of data that catches up with pacing. In the later case, the transport is not really \"application-limited\".",

So inflight may never fall to match the estimated BDP, so the connection may never reach the exit condition for DRAIN (inflight <= estimated_BDP), the connection we may stay in DRAIN forever, or until the first PROBE_RTT forces inflight <= estimated_BDP by setting the cwnd to estimated_BDP.\n\nOne appealing solution to this would be to get rid of the DRAIN state, and instead use the PROBE_BW_DOWN state. The PROBE_BW_DOWN state already has logic that ensures that the connection will exit from that state if it's time to probe for bandwidth again. This would make the code simpler, overall.\n\nA potential downside of this solution would be that the current PROBE_BW_DOWN state uses a pacing gain of 0.90, which would take considerably longer than the DRAIN pacing gain of (0.35 or 0.5, depending on the version of the draft or implementation) to drain any queue that accumulated in STARTUP. It's not clear which is bigger: the potential cost of the additional time to drain the queue, or the potential benefit of the higher pacing gain of 0.9 perhaps avoiding some underutilization (and rebuffers, for video). If 0.9 is too slow to drain the queue then we could consider something like using 0.5 for the first PROBE_BW_DOWN and 0.9 for all later PROBE_BW_DOWN states.\n\nIf we go this route, then instead of PR #6  we would want a PR to describe this new approach.\n\nThis is a significant change, so we'd want some deployment experience and probably an A/B test to verify that any proposed fix works well.\n\ncc: @ianswett @jbeshay \n",

The flow should spend most of its time with a pacing_gain of 0.9x, but this will not pull inflight down much. That's intentional, in order to make fairness convergence work: for a  flow sending below its share to converge to its fair share, it must \"stand its ground\", and maintain data queued in the bottleneck to force faster flows to see a progressively reduced throughput.\n",

To avoid confusion, can you please replace \"RFC\" with \"Internet Draft\"?\r\n\r\n+ To make it easier for folks comparing the Linux TCP BBRv3 code and the draft, can you please pull this pseudocode out into a separate BBRIsProbingBW() function and place it immediately above the BBRHasElapsedInPhase() function, to match the  Linux TCP BBRv3 code here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google/bbr/blob/7542cc7c41c0492a0cdbeb77e295cbfdcd9f5e11/net/ipv4/tcp_bbr.c#L1016\r\n\r\n+ Similarly, can you please reorder the checks to more closely match the Linux TCP BBRv3 code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBBRIsProbingBW():\r\n  return (BBR.state == Startup or\r\n          BBR.state == ProbeBW_REFILL or\r\n          BBR.state == ProbeBW_UP)\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ Can you please share your first and last name?\r\n\r\n+ Is it OK if we add your first and last name to the acknowledgments section?

Depending on the point in time in the round when this happens, this could reduce the time spent in the bandwdith plateau by up to one round. \r\n\r\nBy moving the check for round_start earlier, the estimator is guaranteed to spend 3 full round trips in the plateau.",

This does not directly affect this PR, but it can lead to issue when estimating \"app-limited\" by comparing inflight to cwnd.\r\n\r\nAFAICT that inherent sawtooth should be OK, because the draft defines the point at which the inflight should be checked to look for applicaiton-limited behavior: \"The algorithm detects that an application-limited phase has started when the sending application requests to send new data, or the connection's retransmission mechanisms decide to retransmit data\"",

          "body": "@ianswett I love the idea to reduce the nesting of the \"Delivery Rate Samples\" section.\r\n\r\nI would vote to place the new \"Delivery Rate Samples\" somewhere before the \"Updating Network Path Model Parameters\" section. Rationale: I notice that the \"BBR.max_bw Max Filter\" subsection makes 5 mentions of the phrase \"Delivery rate samples\" in its first few paragraphs. For folks reading the spec linearly, IMHO it would be great to clearly define  \"Delivery Rate Samples\" before the reader gets to the  \"BBR.max_bw Max Filter\" section, which naturally/heavily uses the \"Delivery Rate Samples\"  concept.\r\n\r\nThinking about the overall organization of the sections, I would suggest the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Detailed Algorithm\r\n  4.1 State Machine\r\n  4.2 Algorithm Organization\r\n  4.3 State Machine Operation\r\n  4.4 Input Signals [NEW]\r\n    4.4.1 Delivery Rate Samples [MOVED HERE from current \"4.5.2.1 Delivery Rate Samples\" section]\r\n    4.4.2 RTT Samples [MOVED HERE and renamed from. current \"4.3.4.3 Calculating the rs.rtt RTT Sample\" section]\r\n  4.5 Updating Network Path Model Parameters\r\n     ...\r\n     4.5.5 Updating the BBR.max_bw Max Filter\r\n     ...\r\n     4.5.10 Restarting From Idle [MOVED HERE from \"4.4 Restarting from Idle\"\r\n  4.6 Updating Control Parameters\r\n```\r\n\r\n@ianswett @jbeshay WDYT?\r\n",

It fits better in the flow as you mentioned. It's still a bit too big for a section, but it helps to have it at a higher level with less nesting.\r\nAs a followup, we should also integrate the delivery estimate pseudocode a like we do with other parts. I.e. BBR ack processing and packet transmission references restart from idle and model update pseudocode but not rate estimation.",

Let's start with Christian's suggestion and attempt to fold in Ian's suggestions. Also, I think it is important to separate the \"application\" from the \"connection\", since the connection may have unsent or retransmit data  (or one day FEC data?)  queued for transmission even when the application has nothing to send. How about:\r\n\r\n \"BBR detects that an application-limited phase has started for a connection when congestion control and pacing control would have allowed the connection to send data, and yet the connection is not currently sending data and has no data to send (i.e.,  no unsent/new data, no retransmit data, and no other data, such as encoded data blocks for forward error correction). The precise determination of this condition depends on how the connection uses mechanisms to implement pacing, batching, GSO/TSO/offload, etc.\"",

          "body": "I obviously like the latest proposal from @nealcardwell.\r\n\r\nI think there is a bit more, but we probably want a new issue for that. The \"application limited\" condition is used in two ways:\r\n\r\n- To manage the up-down nature of some applications, with periods of high activity separated by periods of silence or lower activity, the concern being that parameters measured in the past might not be valid when high activity resumes;\r\n- To determine whether a low measurement of the path throughput is due to an actual shrinking of the bottleneck's capacity, or simply due to the application not sending enough data to test that capacity.\r\n\r\nThe first case is reasonably simple to manage, but the second is much more sensitive to batching and TSO issues. Suppose that the window is about 10 packets -- or 10 batches of packets if using TSO. On a given interval, the connection will sometimes send 10 packets, and sometimes 9. If it sends 9, the measurement is likely to fall under the bottleneck bandwidth, but taking that as an estimate of shrinking capacity could be wrong.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether we should consider a different test than \"application limited\". BBR has the concept of the \"nominal CWND\", the product of bottleneck bandwidth estimate and min RTT. If the number of bytes in flight is lower than that, then the measurement will never be larger than the bottleneck bandwidth. Maybe that could be used as a confirmation test: do not lower the bandwidth estimate if not enough data was sent during the period.",

If newly-available data arrives at the connection and the pacing mechanism allows sending even a single packet, then that connection was not pacing limited, but rather was application-limited (essentially, waiting for the application to send that single packet that was already permisable to send).\r\n\r\n(3) One potential way to perhaps clear up some of the fuzziness would be to mention the quantum enforcement explicitly. Something like the following (note the new number 4 item):\r\n\r\n```\r\n2. All the packets considered lost have been retransmitted.\r\n\r\n3. The sending flow is not currently in the process of transmitting a packet.\r\n\r\n4. The quantum scheduler permits an aggregate containing one or more packets to be sent now.\r\n\r\n6. The pacing enforcement mechanism permits a packet to be sent now.\r\n\r\n7. The congestion window permits a packet to be sent now, i.e.,\r\n   C.inflight is less than C.cwnd.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@ianswett @jbeshay @huitema what do you think of this version (3)?\r\n\r\n@huitema : if you don't like this (3) proposal, to ease the process of making forward progress, can you please make a specific, concrete suggestion for text you would like to see?\r\n",

I believe one big difference is that when PTO (aka RTO) fires in QUIC, inflight > 0, but I think TCP declares everything unacked as lost and starts over? Put another way, QUIC never declares a packet lost due to an RTO/PTO. \r\n\r\nFWIW, in TCP PTO and RTO are very different:\r\n\r\n+ At PTO, nothing is marked lost,  cwnd stays the same, and the sender sends 1 packet.\r\n\r\n+ At RTO, everything sent more than 1 RTT ago is marked as lost, cwnd is reset to inflight + 1 packet, and the sender sends 1 packet.\r\n\r\n> Is this the main problematic case, or are there others? If this is it, we could check bytes_in_flight == 0 and that we're not in RTO?\r\n\r\nThe problematic case is a spurious loss detection event: the data-sending connection thinks there is nothing in the network that could be ACKed in the future, but the connection is wrong; there is something in the network that is ACKed in the future.\r\n\r\nRTO is one of the problematic cases, but the problematic case can happen with any kind of loss recovery, including ACK/SACK-triggered fast recovery. Any decision that a packet was lost in the network is a heuristic, and can be wrong; the packet may simply have been delayed or reordered.\r\n\r\nThis code path that sets \"C.first_sent_time = C.delivered_time = P.sent_time\", is basically switching from the normal \"delivery_rate = \u0394delivered /\u0394time\" calculation to a \"delivery_rate = \u0394delivered / RTT\" calculation.\r\n\r\nIf there is a spurious loss detection event, and the delivery rate sampling code thinks inflight is 0, and erroneously executes this code path to set \"C.first_sent_time = C.delivered_time = P.sent_time\", then basically the data sender is erroneously switching from the normal \"delivery_rate = \u0394delivered /\u0394time\" calculation to a \"delivery_rate = \u0394delivered / RTT\" calculation.\r\n\r\nAs noted in slides 7-8 that I cooked for the BBR IETF 99 slides ( https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99/slides/slides-99-iccrg-iccrg-presentation-2-00.pdf ) the \"delivery_rate = \u0394delivered / RTT\" approach is not safe in the general case where data is outstanding at the time of transmission.\r\n\r\n+ Here is what  \"delivery_rate = \u0394delivered /\u0394time\"  looks like: https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99/slides/slides-99-iccrg-iccrg-presentation-2-00.pdf#page=7\r\n\r\n+ Here is what \"delivery_rate = \u0394delivered / RTT\" looks like: https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99/slides/slides-99-iccrg-iccrg-presentation-2-00.pdf#page=8\r\n\r\nIn the diagram, note that the \"delivery_rate = \u0394delivered / RTT\" approach overestimates the slope of the \"y = delivered packets vs x = time\" step function, by calculating the slope of a line that is neither tangent to the \"knee\" of each step, nor tangent to the \"ankle\" of each step. The problem with \"delivery_rate = \u0394delivered / RTT\" is that it can essentially estimate an inter-ACK delay of epsilon seconds instead of the real inter-ACK delay represented by the \"knee to knee\" (or \"ankle to ankle\") time.\r\n\r\nAFAICT, when erroneously using \"delivery_rate = \u0394delivered / RTT\", a plausible worst-case delivery rate overestimation factor is something like 3x. That's in the case where the delivery rate for the path is 1 packet per RTT, and the connection has 2 packets in flight, spuriously marks both packets as lost, transmits a new packet, then epsilon secs later gets the ACKs for the 2 packets it spuriously marked as lost, then 1 RTT later gets the ACK for the 1 packet it most recently transmitted. That causes the delivery_rate sample to be \"delivery_rate = (3 packets) / (1 RTT) = 3 packets/RTT\" when the real delivery_rate is 1 packet/RTT.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue I noticed in actual testing, not a purely theoretical issue, and (at least in TCP) the fix is simple, has 0 space overhead, and actually makes the code faster than using inflight.\r\n\r\nSo IMHO it's important that both the spec and the QUIC implementations use UnacknolwedgedBytes() here. :-)\r\n\r\nSo IMHO we just have to figure out how to express this in a clear and transport-agnostic way. I think this boils down to needing to find a way to express \"there is nothing in the network that could be ACKed in the future\" in a transport-agnostic way. In TCP this is a simple (SND.NXT == SND.UNA)... but I don't know how to express this in QUIC... :-)\r\n\r\n",

If so, then that would be a good place to fire this logic.\r\n> \r\n> There's a check to skip ProbeRTT if inflight is low for long enough, and there's information about whether BBR is app-limited. A simple check we could do today is that bytes_in_flight is 0 and we were app-limited? Though I don't think that's perfect.\r\n\r\nWe have that logic in BBR itself, not quic-specific. We set idle restart on packet sent `if (C.inflight == 0 and C.app_limited)`. Re-using that wouldn't be too bad.\r\n",

              "body": "I suspect it will cause confusion and objections if we use \"SMSS\" and say that it \"is equivalent to PMTU in QUIC {{RFC9000, Section 14.2}}\". I can think of at least two significant differences between SMSS and PMTU:\r\n\r\n(1) TCP SMSS is constrained not just by the PMTU, but also by the MSS option the remote peer communicated in its SYN packet.\r\n\r\n(2) TCP SMSS does not include TCP/IP headers but QUIC PMTU does include UDP/IP headers. The https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5681#section-2 defines SMSS such that the SMSS \"size does not include the TCP/IP headers and options\" but https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-14.2 defines PMTU to include IP/UDP headers (\"The PMTU is the maximum size of the entire IP packet, including the IP header, UDP header, and UDP payload\"). \r\n\r\n(3) TCP SMSS is the size of the packet used for congestion control purposes, but in QUIC the PMTU size (full L3 packet including L3 headers and L4+ bytes) is different than the size used for CC purposes in RFC9002, where bytes_in_flight does not include L3/IP or UDP overhead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as how exactly to define the packet size for BBR purposes, it seems we have a few existing approaches we could try to match:\r\n\r\n+ QUIC CC has thus far in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9002#section-b.2 defines bytes_in_flight as including L4 headers and L4 payload.\r\n\r\n+ The TCP Reno CC in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5681#section-2  defines TCP cwnd control in terms of L4 payload bytes only, and SMSS in terms of payload bytes.\r\n\r\n+ CUBIC CC in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9438#section-4.1.2 says cwnd is in segments, aka SMSS bytes. Looking at CUBIC RFC 9438, when it introduces SMSS it simply says \"Sender Maximum Segment Size (SMSS) bytes\". The definitions section says: \"The unit of all window sizes in this document is segments of the SMSS, and the unit of all times is seconds. Implementations can use bytes to express window sizes, which would require factoring in the SMSS wherever necessary and replacing segments_acked ([Figure 4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9438#eq4)) with the number of acknowledged bytes.\"\r\n\r\nI can see two main options:\r\n\r\n(1) Just follow the CUBIC example and use  \"Sender Maximum Segment Size (SMSS)\" without defining it further.\r\n\r\n(2) Try to come up with a transport-agnostic term that avoids confusion/ambiguity. Perhaps instead of C.SMSS we could use C.SMPS: (Sender Maximum Packet Size), defined as  the maximum packet size the sender choses to send, including whatever portion of the packet that the transport protocol implentation tracks for congestion control purposes. This portion MUST include L4 payload.  This MAY be just L4 payload (like TCP SMSS). This MAY be L4 payload plus L4 headers (like QUIC max_datagram_size). Protocol implementations MAY use L2 headers through L4 payload, or L3 headers through L4 payload.\r\n\r\nI would lean toward (2), to avoid baking in this SMSS term that is TCP-centric.\r\n\r\n@ianswett @jbeshay WDYT?\r\n",

The impact on C.cwnd is primarily a function of the MinRTTFilterLen not just ProbeRTTInterval. Increasing the ProbeRTTInterval (as long as it's still less than MinRTTFilterLen) shouldn't decrease the BBR.min_rtt estimate used for C.cwnd calculation. So this throughput penalty is actually on the same side of the trade-off as speed of convergence. I.e. a smaller ProbeRTTInterval leads to faster convergence and the potential for min_rtt underestimation causing smaller cwnd. While a larger ProbeRTTInterval leads to slower convergence and is less likely to have underestimated min_rtt. ",

In this case, the offload budget SHOULD\r\nbe increased to include the amount of data that can be scheduled for future transmissions\r\nby the pacing offload mechanism.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, QUIC receivers might acknowledge packets less often...\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

I have updated the PR along those lines: \"For example, this is true for all QUIC connections by virtue of the QUIC ACK Range {{RFC9000}} mechanism\".\r\n\r\n> selective acknowledgements seems a bit odd for QUIC, but I am struggling to find a better term. discontiguous acknowledgements is correct, but maybe not any better?\r\n\r\nThanks, Ian. I agree it's not ideal to use \"selective acknowledgments\" since it\r\nprivileges TCP over QUIC. If we can come up with a more generic phrase\r\nthat encompasses both \"selective acknowledgment\" and \"ack range\",\r\nthat's great.\r\n\r\nBut FWIW if we use some phrase that is more generic, IMHO we will need\r\na bigger surgery, since in the draft we already use \"selective\r\nacknowledgments\" or \"selectively acknowledge\" 5 times:\r\n\r\n+ While selective acknowledgments for out-of-order data (e.g., [RFC2018]) are not required, such a mechanism is highly recommended\r\n\r\n+ ACKs may contain both cumulative and selective acknowledgment information\r\n\r\n+ RS.newly_acked: The volume of data cumulatively or selectively acknowledged upon the ACK that was just received.\r\n\r\n+ Each acknowledgment that cumulatively or selectively acknowledges that the network has delivered new data\r\n\r\n+ rate samples only include packets actually cumulatively and/or selectively acknowledged\r\n",
